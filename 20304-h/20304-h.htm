<h1>A TRIP<br />
TO<br />
PARIS.</h1>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="ROAD" id="ROAD"></a>ROAD FROM CALAIS. UNNECESSARY PASSPORTS. CHANTILLY.</h3>


<p>THE following excursion was undertaken for several reasons: the first of
which was, that though I had been many times in Paris before, yet I had
not once been there since the Revolution, and I was desirous of seeing
how far a residence of a few years in France might be practicable and
agreeable; secondly, a Counter-Revolution, or, at least, some violent
measures were expected, and I was willing to be there at the time, if
possible;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> and lastly, I wanted to examine the gardens near Paris.</p>

<p>I must here premise that I sent for a passport from the Secretary of
State's office, which I knew could do no harm if it did no good,
thinking I should have it for nothing, and obtained one signed by Lord
Grenville, but at the same time a demand was made for <i>two guineas and
sixpence</i> for the fees; now, as I have had passports from almost all the
European nations, <i>all and every one</i> of which were <i>gratis</i>, I sent the
pass back; it was however immediately returned to me, and I was told
that, "A passport is never issued from that office without that fee,
even if the party asking for it changes his mind." <i>I paid the money,
and that is all I shall say about the matter.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Chauvelin</i> (the minister from France) sent me his pass <i>gratis</i>;
those which I afterwards received in Paris from <i>Lord Gower</i>, and the
very essential one from <i>Mr. Petion</i>, were likewise <i>gratis</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>That of <i>Mr. Chauvelin</i> has at the top a small engraving of three
<i>Fleurs de Lys</i> between two oak branches, surmounted by a crown: at the
bottom is another small engraving, with his cypher F. C. it was dated
London, <i>17th</i> July, 1792, 4th year of Liberty.</p>

<p><i>No passport of any kind is necessary to enter France.</i> At Calais one
was given to me by the magistrates, mentioning my age, stature,
complexion, &amp;c. and this would have been a sufficient permit for my
going out of France by sea or by land, if the disturbances in Paris, of
the 10th of August, had not happened.</p>

<p>I embarked at Dover on the 25th July, at one in the afternoon, and
landed at Calais after a pleasant passage of three hours and a half.</p>

<p>I immediately procured a national cockade, which was a silk ribband,
with blue, white, and red stripes; changed twenty guineas for forty
livres each, in paper, (the real value is not more than twenty-five
livres) hired a <i>cabriolet</i>, or two wheeled post-chaise of <i>Dessin</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
(which was to take me to Paris, and bring me back in a month) for three
<i>louis d'ors</i> in money, bought a post-book, drank a bottle of Burgundy,
and set off directly for <i>Marquise</i> (about fifteen miles) where I passed
the night.</p>

<p>The next day, 26th, I proceeded only to <i>Abbeville</i>, and it was ten at
night when I got there, because a gentleman in the chaise with me, and
another gentleman and his wife, who had not been in France before, and
who accompanied us all the way to Paris, wished to see Boulogne. We
accordingly walked round the ramparts, and then went on.</p>

<p>The 27th we remained a few hours at <i>Amiens</i>, and saw the cathedral and
the engine which supplies the city with water, called <i>La Tour d'Eau</i>.
We slept at <i>Breteuil</i> which is a paltry town (<i>Bourg</i>.)</p>

<p>The 28th. We were five hours occupied in seeing <i>Chantilly</i>. This palace
is the most magnificent of any in Europe, not belonging to a sovereign.
In the cabinet of natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> history, which has lately been very
considerably augmented, by the addition of that of <i>Mr. Valmont de
Bomare</i> (who arranged the whole) I observed the <i>f&oelig;tus</i> of a whale,
about fourteen inches long, preserved in spirits; and the skin of a wolf
stuffed. I saw this identical wolf at <i>Montargis</i>, a palace beyond
<i>Fontainebleau</i>, in 1784, soon after it had been shot. The carp came, as
usual, to be fed by hand. Some of them are said to have been here above
a century. As to the gardens, they are well known; all that I shall say
is, that they do not contain a single curious tree, shrub, or flower. We
hired a landau, at the inn, to drive us about these gardens, and in the
evening proceeded to <i>St. Denis</i>, which is only a single post from
Paris, where we remained, as it would not have been so convenient to
seek for a lodging there at night.</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday 29th, early in the morning, we entered Paris, and
put up at the <i>H&ocirc;tel d'Espagne</i>, <i>Rue du Colombier</i>, and in the evening
went to the opera of <i>Corisandre</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="EXPENCES" id="EXPENCES"></a>EXPENCES.</h3>


<p>THE whole expences of our journey from Calais to Paris was as follows.
The distance is thirty-four posts and a half, the last of which must be
paid double.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The two chaises were each drawn by two horses, at 30
sous per horse, and 20 sous to each postillion per post, is 35 and half
posts, at eight <i>livres</i>, is <i>Livres</i> 284.</p>

<table summary="greasing" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="right">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="right"><i>&pound;.</i> 540</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This, at 40 livres per guinea, amounts to thirteen guineas and a half;
to which must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> added, for the hire of the two chaises to Paris, three
<i>Louis</i> in money, adequate to three pounds sterling, which altogether
does not amount to four guineas each person, travelling post above two
hundred miles, and faring sumptuously on the road, drinking Burgundy and
Champagne, and being as well received at the inns as if the expences had
been quadrupled. One hot meal a day, at three <i>livres</i> a head, one
<i>livre</i> for each bed, and the wine paid for apart, was the customary
allowance. After this manner I have travelled several times all over
France, to <i>Bourdeaux</i>, <i>Toulouse</i>, <i>Montpelier</i>, <i>Marseille</i>, <i>Toulon</i>,
<i>Hieres</i>, <i>Avignon</i>, <i>Lyon</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Had the exchange been at par, the expence would have been doubled, in
English money; but even then would have been very reasonable, compared
to the cost of a similar journey in England.</p>

<p>At Paris I received 42 livres 15 sous for each guinea; soon after which
I was paid forty-two livres for every pound sterling which I drew on
London: on my return to Calais I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> found the exchange to be forty-four
livres per guinea, and once it was as high as forty-nine. This, of
course, very much injures the trade between England and France; but, for
the same reason, English families residing in France at present, more
than double their income, by drawing bills on London for such income,
and it will probably be many years before the exchange will be at <i>par</i>
again.</p>

<h3><a name="OBSERVATIONS" id="OBSERVATIONS"></a>MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. CHESSMEN. TREE OF LIBERTY. CRUCIFIXES,VIRGINS. SAINTS. BISHOPS. OLD WOMEN, &amp;C.</h3>


<p>THE whole way from Calais to Paris the land was in the highest state of
cultivation.</p>

<p>The sandy soil near the gates of Calais abounded with the <i>Chelidonium
Glaucium</i>, or common yellow horned poppy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The first vines on this road are about a mile on this side of Breteuil.</p>

<p>Between St. Just and Clermont is a magnificent <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> and garden
belonging to the <i>ci-devant Duc de Fitzjames</i>: this seat has never been
described; it is not shewn to strangers at present, as the proprietor is
emigrated.</p>

<p>The country all around Chantilly, consists of cornfields; formerly it
appeared barren, because the immense quantity of game which infested and
over-ran it devoured all the crops and ruined the farmers, who were sent
to the gallies if they shot a bird.</p>

<p>I passed this way in 1783 and 1784, and saw vast numbers of pheasants,
partridges, and hares cross the road, and feed by the side of it, as
tame as poultry in a farm-yard; but at present the game is all
destroyed; neither are there any more wild boars in the forest, which is
of 7600 acres. These animals still inhabit the forest of
<i>Fontainebleau</i>. This forest (which covers almost four times as much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
ground as that of <i>Chantilly</i>)<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> contains a greater number of trees, of
a more enormous size, than I have seen in any other part of Europe,
growing amongst rocks and stones equally remarkable for their
dimensions. I know not of any parallel to the <i>sublime-beautiful</i>, and
to the wild and romantic grandeur of the scenery here displayed. The
landscapes of <i>Salvator Rosa</i> appear to have been taken from natural
objects, similar to those which are here seen. It is only forty miles
from Paris.</p>

<p>In the treasury of the Abbey at <i>St. Denis</i> were formerly preserved the
Chess-men of <i>Charlemagne</i>; these I described in the first volume of
<i>Chess</i>, published in 1787; they are now either <i>stolen or strayed</i>, and
will probably never more be heard of.</p>

<p>All the horses (many of which were stone-horses) we had occasion to make
use of along this road were very gentle, and so were the cattle which
were feeding on the grass growing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> on the borders of the cornfields,
(without any inclosure) which they were prevented from entering by a
string tied to their horns, one end of which was sometimes held by a
child of five or six years old. The people here are very merciful and
kind to their beasts. I have seen droves of oxen walking leisurely
through the green markets in the cities, smelling at the vegetables, and
driven to the slaughter-house by children. There are no instances here
of mad oxen, mad dogs, or run-away horses.</p>

<p>In every one of the towns between Calais and Paris a full-grown tree
(generally a poplar) has been planted in the market-place, with many of
its boughs and leaves; these last being withered, it makes but a dismal
appearance; on the top of this tree or pole is a red woollen or cotton
night-cap, which is called the <i>Cap of Liberty</i>, with streamers about
the pole, of red, blue and white ribbands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw several statues of saints, both within and without the churches
(and in Paris likewise) with similar caps, and several crucifixes with
the national cockade of ribbands tied to the left arm of the image on
the cross, but not one with the cockade in its proper place; the reason
of which I know not.</p>

<p>I was both surprised and sorry to see the wooden images, many of them as
large as the life, on crosses, painted with the natural colours, to the
amount of perhaps twenty between <i>Calais</i> and <i>Paris</i>, still suffered to
remain nuisances on the side of the road. The <i>perpendicular</i> of each
cross being seasoned, by having been exposed many years to the open air,
might make a couple of excellent pike staves;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but the remainder
would, as far as I know, be of no other use than for fuel.</p>

<p>Another absurdity which has not been attended to as yet is, that most of
the almanacks, even that which is prefixed to Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> <i>Rabaut's</i> Account of
the Revolution, contains against every day in the year, the name of some
saint or other, male or female; some of them martyrs, and others not,
others archangels, angels, arch-bishops, bishops, popes, and virgins, to
the number of twenty-four, and of these, four were martyrs into the
bargain; and this at a time when churches are selling by auction and
pulling down, when the convents are turned into barracks, when there is
neither monk nor nun to be seen in the kingdom, nor yet any <i>Abbe</i>, and
when no priest dares appear in any sacerdotal garment, or even with any
thing which might mark him as an ecclesiastic. It must however be
acknowledged, that the saints have lost all their credit in France, and
of course so have the <i>Bienheureux</i>, or <i>Blessed</i>. In order to arrive at
saint-hood, the candidate must first have died <i>en odeur de Saintet&eacute;</i>,
which, were it not too ludicrous, might be translated <i>smelling of
holiness</i>; he was then created a <i>Bienheureux</i>, and after he had been
dead a century, the pope might canonize him if he pleased; after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> which
he, the saint, might work miracles if he could, or let it alone.</p>

<p>France formerly contained eighteen arch-bishopricks, and one hundred and
thirteen bishopricks; the <i>Arch ones</i> are all abolished, and likewise
forty-seven of the others; there are, however, plenty remaining, no less
than seventy-three, which includes seven new ones, and one in <i>Corsica</i>.</p>

<p>The churches in Paris are not much frequented on the week days, at
present; I found a few old women on their knees in some of them, hearing
mass; and, at the same time, at the other end of one of these churches
commissaries were sitting and entering the names of volunteers for the
army.</p>

<p>The iron rails in the churches which part the choir from the nave, and
also those which encompass chapels and tombs, are all ordered to be
converted into heads for pikes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sundays, before the 19th of August, the churches were still resorted
to, but by no means crowded; I know not whether this be the case now.</p>

<p>All the <i>jours de f&ecirc;te</i>, holidays, are very judiciously abolished, and
likewise <i>les jours gras, et maigres</i>, (Flesh and meagre days.)</p>

<p>All shops are allowed to be open, and every trade carried on on Sundays,
notwithstanding which, few are open excepting those where provisions are
sold; the inhabitants choosing to have one day's relaxation in seven, to
take a little fresh air, and to appear well dressed.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="WALL" id="WALL"></a>WALL ROUND PARIS. NEW BRIDGE. FIELD OF THE FEDERATION. BASTILLE.</h3>


<p>THERE is a Wall which encompasses Paris, of about twelve feet high and
two feet thick, about nine miles long on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> North side, and five on
the South side; this was built just before the Revolution, and was
intended to prevent goods from being smuggled into Paris. On the North
side are thirty-six barriers, and on the other side eighteen; of these
fifty-four I saw only ten. They were intended for the officers of the
customs; at present they are used as guardrooms. Most of them are
magnificent buildings, of white stone, some like temples, others like
chapels; several of these are described in the new <i>Paris Guides</i>; but
views of none of them have as yet been engraven.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>A bridge of white stone was just finished and opened for the passage of
carriages; it was begun in 1787, it is of five arches, the centre arch
is ninety-six feet wide, the two collateral ones eighty-seven feet each,
and other two seventy-eight, each of these arches forms part of a
circle, whose centre is considerably under the level of the water; it is
thrown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> over the river from the <i>Place de Louis XV.</i> to the <i>Palais
Bourbon</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Champ de la Federation</i>, formerly <i>Champ de Mars</i>, is a field which
served for the exercises of the pupils of the Royal Military School; it
is a regular parallelogram of nine hundred yards long, and three hundred
yards broad, exclusive of the ditches by which it is bounded, and of the
quadruple rows of trees on each side; but if these are included the
breadth is doubled. At one extremity is the magnificent building
above-mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and the river runs at the foot of the others. In
this field is formed the largest <i>Circus</i> in the world, being eight
hundred yards long and four hundred broad; it is bordered by a slope of
forty yards broad,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> and of which the highest part is ten feet above the
level ground; the lower part is cut into thirty rows, gradually elevated
above each other, and on these rows or ridges a hundred and sixty
thousand persons may fit commodiously; the upper part may contain about
a hundred and fifty thousand persons standing, of which every one may
see equally well what is doing in the <i>Circus</i>. The National
confederation was first held here, 14th July, 1790, and at that time a
wooden bridge was thrown on boats over the river for convenience.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Bastille</i> nothing remains but the foundations; it was demolished
and levelled with the ground in about eleven months; the expences at the
end of the first three months amounted to about twenty thousand pounds
sterling. The materials were sold for half that sum, and the nation paid
the remainder. And on the 14th of July, 1790, the anniversary of the day
of its having been taken, a long mast was erected in the middle of the
place where it stood, crowned with flowers and ribbands, and bearing
this simple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> and expressive inscription; <i>Ici on Danse</i>. Here is
dancing.</p>

<p>IN the <i>H&ocirc;tel de la Monnoye</i> (the Mint) I procured some new coins. The
silver crown piece of six livres has on one side the king's head in
profile, round which is <i>Louis XVI. Roi des Fran&ccedil;ois</i>, 1792; over this
date is a small lion passant, being a Mint mark. The reverse, is a human
figure with an enormous pair of wings,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> holding a book in its left
hand, which book rests on an altar, and with its other is represented as
if writing in it; the word <i>Constitution</i> is already seen there. The
figure is naked, except a slight drapery on the left arm; behind the
figure is a bundle of staves, like the Roman Fasces, surmounted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> by the
cap of liberty, and behind the altar is a cock standing on one leg; the
inscription is <i>Regne de la Loi</i>. <i>L'An 4 de la Libert&eacute;.</i> Besides this,
there are two other Mint marks, one a small lyre, and the other the
letter A; at the foot of the altar is <i>Dupre</i>, the name of the person
who engraved the die; and on the edge is <i>La Nation</i>, <i>La Loi</i>, <i>et le
Roi</i>, in <i>Relievo</i>.</p>

<p>There are no new half crowns. The dies of the new thirty and fifteen sol
pieces are just like that of the crown, except that their value is
stamped on them 30 <i>Sols</i>, 15 <i>Sols</i>, and that there is no inscription
on the edge.</p>

<p>There are two other coins, made of a sort of bell-metal; one of two
<i>Sols</i>, with the king's profile; inscription and date like those on the
silver coin, and on the reverse the <i>Fasces</i> and cap, between two oak
branches, and the inscription, <i>La Nation, Le Loi, Le Roi. L'an</i> 4 <i>de
la Libert&eacute;. 2 S</i>. The other of half this size, and with the same
impressions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> except that its value is specified thus, 12 D. or
<i>Deniers</i>, equal to one <i>Sol</i>.</p>

<p>I have not seen any new Louis. No paper money or assignats is known in
the Mint; I bought some coins here, and paid for them in guineas, which
are currant for twenty-five livres. There are twelve or fourteen mills,
which were all at work in coining crown pieces, and likewise several
hammering machines, one of which was coining 2 <i>Sols</i> pieces.</p>

<p>Besides the national coins, several tradesmen have been permitted to
fabricate silver and copper medals or <i>tokens</i>, for public convenience,
the most beautiful of which are those of <i>M. Monneron</i>. The largest is
of almost pure copper, exactly of the size and thickness of the crown
piece; in an oval is represented a female figure with a helmet on,
sitting on an elevated place, on which is <i>Dupre f.</i> (or fecit) holding
a book, inscribed <i>Constitution des Fran&ccedil;ois</i>; at her side is a shield
with the arms of France, and at her feet an altar, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> one side of which
is the profile of the king; several soldiers are represented extending
their right arms, as if taking the oath; at top is <i>Pacte Federatif</i>; at
bottom 14 <i>Juillet</i>, 1790; round the oval <i>vivre libres ou mourir</i>,
which is repeated in one of the banners carried by a soldier. On the
reverse, in a circle, is <i>Medaille de confiance de cinq-sols
remboursable en assignats de</i> 50<sup>L</sup> <i>et au dessus</i>. <i>L'An IV. de la
Libert&eacute;</i>; round this is <i>Monneron Freres Negocians &agrave; Paris</i>, 1792; and
on the edge is cut <i>Departemens de Paris</i>, <i>Rhone et Loire</i>. <i>Du Gard</i>.</p>

<p>I have another of these pieces, not quite so large nor so well executed;
one of the sides is similar to that already described; on the other is
<i>Medaille qui se vend</i> 5 <i>Sols &agrave; Paris chez Monneron patent&eacute;</i>. <i>L'An IV.
de la Libert&eacute;</i>. Round this is, <i>Revolution Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, 1792; and on the
edge, <i>Bon pour les</i> 83 <i>Departemens</i>. I am told this was made at
Birmingham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The other token of the same merchant is rather larger and thicker than
our halfpenny. On one side is a woman sitting, with a staff in her right
hand with the cap of liberty; her left arm leans on a square tablet, on
which are the words, <i>Droits de l'Homme. Artic. V.</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the sun shines
just over her head, and behind her is a cock perched on half a fluted
column; round the figure, <i>Libert&eacute; sous la Loi</i>, and underneath, <i>L'An
III. de la Libert&eacute;</i>. On the reverse, <i>Medaille de confiance de deux sols
&agrave; echanger contre des assignats de 50<sup>L</sup> et au dessus. 1791</i>. Round
this the merchant's name, as in the first; and on the edge, <i>Bon pour
Bord. Marseil. Lyon. Rouen. Nant. et Strasb</i>.</p>

<p>I have seen a silver token almost as big as a shilling. On one side is
represented a woman sitting, leaning with her left arm on a large open
book, at her right is a cock perched on half a fluted column; and the
inscription round these figures is, <i>Le Fevre, Le Sage et Comp<sup>ie.</sup>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>n<sup>gt.</sup> &agrave; Paris</i>. On the reverse is <i>B.P.</i> (bon pour) 20 <i>Sols &agrave;
echanger en assignats</i> de 50<sup>L</sup> and round this, <i>et au dessus l'an 4 me
de la Libert&eacute;</i>, 1792.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In this H&ocirc;tel is the cabinet of the royal school of mineralogy, which
Mr. Le Sage has been four and twenty years in forming and analyzing; it
is contained in a magnificent building, with a dome and gallery almost
entirely of marble.</p>

<h3><a name="THEATRES" id="THEATRES"></a>THEATRES.</h3>


<p>AT this time there were ten regular theatres open every evening. The
first and most ancient of which is the Opera, or Royal Academy of Music.
The old house which was in the Palais Royal, was burnt in 1781, and the
present house, near St. Martin's Gate, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> built in seventy-five days.
The number of performers, vocal and instrumental, dancers, &amp;c. employed
in this theatre is about four hundred and thirty. The price of admission
to the first boxes is seven livres ten sous, about six shillings and
eight pence, (or three shillings and four pence as the exchange then
was.)</p>

<p>2. The <i>French</i> playhouse is at present called <i>Theatre de la Nation</i>.
In the vestibule or porch is a marble statue of <i>Voltaire</i>, sitting in
an arm chair; it is near the Luxembourg.</p>

<p>3. The Italian theatre behind the <i>Boulevart Richelieu</i>. Notwithstanding
the name, nothing but French pieces, and French music, are performed
here.</p>

<p>4. Theatre <i>de Monsieur</i>. <i>Rue Feydeau</i>. Comedies and operas are
performed here, three times a week in the Italian, and the other days in
the French language; for which purpose two sets of players are engaged
at this house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Theatre Fran&ccedil;ais. Rue de Richelieu. At these four theatres the price
of admission into the boxes was a crown.</p>

<p>6. Theatre de la Rue de Louvois.</p>

<p>7. Theatre Fran&ccedil;ais. Rue de Bondy.</p>

<p>8. Theatre de la Demoiselle Montansier, au Palais Royal. The box price
of these three last was half a crown.</p>

<p>9. Theatre du Marais, quartier St. Antoine.</p>

<p>10. Theatre de Moliere. Rue St. Martin.</p>

<p>To these must be added about five and twenty more; the best of which is
the <i>Theatre de l'ambigu comique</i>, on the <i>North Boulevarts</i>;
<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
box price was half a crown. The others were rope dancers, and such kind
of spectacles as <i>Sadler's Wells, &amp;c.</i> and the prices were from two
shillings down to sixpence. The French themselves, laughing at the great
increase of their theatres, said, "We shall shortly have a public
spectacle per street, an actor per house, a musician per cellar, and an
author per garret."</p>

<p>THE new church of <i>Sainte Genevieve</i> was begun in 1757; but the building
was discontinued during the last war; in 1784 it was resumed, and is at
present almost finished. The whole length of the front is thus inscribed
in very large gilt capitals: <i>Aux grands hommes: la Patrie
reconnoissante</i>. To great men: their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> grateful country. And over the
entrance: <i>Pantheon Fran&ccedil;ais. L'An III de la Libert&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>As to the size of Paris, I saw two very large plans of that city and of
London, on the same scale, on which it was said, that Paris covered
5,280,000 square <i>Toises</i>, and London only 3,900,000. A <i>Toise</i> is two
yards; and from the plan it appeared to be near the truth.</p>

<p>The new buildings which surround the garden of the Palais Royal form a
parallelogram, that for beauty is not to be matched in Europe. They
consist of shops, coffee-houses, music rooms, four of which are in
cellars, taverns, gaming-houses, &amp;c. and the whole square is almost
always full of people. The square is 234 yards in length, and 100 in
breadth; the portico which surround it consists of 180 arches.</p>

<p>The celebrated <i>Jacobins</i> are a club, consisting at present of about
1300 members, and so called, because the place of meeting is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> the
hall which was formerly the library of the convent of that name, in the
<i>Rue St. Honor&eacute;</i>, about 300 yards distant from the National Assembly.
The proper name of the club is, <i>Society of the Friends of the
Constitution</i>. There are three or four other societies of less note.</p>

<p>The <i>Quai</i>, which was formerly called <i>des Theatins</i> is at present named
<i>Quai Voltaire</i>, in honor of that philosopher, who died there in the
house of the Marquis de <i>Villette</i>, in 1778.</p>

<p>The street which was formerly called <i>Platriere</i>, and in which the
general post-office is situated, is called <i>Rue Jean Jaques Rousseau</i>,
in honour of this writer, who resided some time in this street. I found
him here in 1776, and he copied some music for me; he had no other books
at that time than an English <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and an Italian <i>Tasso's
Jerusalem</i>. He died 1st July, 1778, very soon after Voltaire, at the
country seat of le Marquis <i>de Girardin</i> about ten leagues from Paris;
and is buried there, in a small island.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>And the street which was formerly called <i>Chauss&eacute;e d'Antin</i> is now named
<i>Rue de Mirabeau</i>, in honour of the late patriot of that name.</p>

<p>The church <i>des Innocens</i> was pulled down in 1786, and the vast
<i>cimeti&eacute;re</i> (burying ground) was filled up. Every night, during several
months, carts were employed in carrying the bones found there, to other
grounds out of Paris; it is now a market for vegetables. Very near this
place was a fountain, which is mentioned in letters patent so long ago
as 1273. It was rebuilt with extraordinary magnificence in 1550,
repaired in 1708, and at last, in 1788, carefully removed to the center
of the market, where it now stands.</p>

<p>The new <i>Quai de Gesvres</i> was constructed in 1787, and all the shops
which formed a long narrow alley for foot passengers only, were
destroyed.</p>

<p>At this time no person was permitted to walk in any other part of the
<i>Tuileries</i> gardens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> than in the terrace of the <i>Feuillans</i>, which is
parallel to the <i>Rue St. Honor&eacute;</i>, and under the windows of the <i>National
Assembly</i>; the only fence to the other part of the garden was a blue
ribband extended between two chairs.</p>

<p>Hitherto cockades of silk had been worn, the <i>aristocrats</i> wore such as
were of a paler blue and red, than those worn by the <i>democrats</i>, and
the former were even distinguished by their carriages, on which a cloud
was painted upon the arms, which entirely obliterated them, (of these I
saw above thirty in the evening <i>promenade</i>, in the <i>Bois de Boulogne</i>:)
but on the 30th of July, every person was compelled by the people to
wear a linen cockade, without any distinction in the red and blue
colours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>ON the 4th of August a criminal was beheaded, in the <i>Place de Gr&ecirc;ve</i>. I
did not see the execution, because, as the hour is never specified, I
might have waited many hours in a crowd, from which there is no
extricating one's self. I was there immediately after, and saw the
machine, which was just going to be taken away. I went into a
coffee-house and made a drawing, which is here engraven. It is called
<i>la Guillotine</i>, from the name of the person who first brought it into
use in Paris: that at <i>Lisle</i> is called <i>le Louison</i>, for a similar
reason. In English it is termed a maiden.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>I have seen the following seven engravings of such an instrument. The
most ancient is engraven on wood, merely outlines, and very badly drawn;
it is in <i>Petrus de Natalibus Catalogus Sanctorum, 1510</i>.</p>

<p>There was a German translation of some of <i>Petrarch's</i> Works, published
in 1520; this contains an engraving in wood, representing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> an execution,
with a great number of figures, correctly drawn.</p>

<p><i>Aldegrever</i>, in 1553, published another print on this subject.</p>

<p>The fourth is in <i>Achillis Bocchii Qu&aelig;stiones Symbolic&aelig;</i>, 1550.</p>

<p>There is one in <i>Cats's</i> Dutch Emblems, 1650.</p>

<p>And the two last are in <i>Golfrieds's</i> Historical Chronicles, in German,
folio, 1674. These five last are engraven on copper.</p>

<p>In all these representations the axe is either straight or semicircular,
but always horizontal. The sloping position of the French axe appears to
be the best calculated for celerity.</p>

<p>Machines of this kind are at present made use of for executions
throughout all France, and criminals are put to death in no other
manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is the account of an execution, which I had from an
eye-witness.</p>

<p>The crowd began to assemble at ten in the morning, and waited, exposed
to the intense heat of the sun in the middle of July, till four in the
afternoon, when the criminals, a Marquis and a Priest, were brought, in
two coaches; they were condemned for having forged <i>assignats</i>.</p>

<p>The Marquis ascended the scaffold first; he was as pale as if he had
already been dead, and he endeavoured to hide his face, by pulling his
hair over it; there were two executioners, dressed in black, on the
scaffold, one of which immediately tied a plank of about 18 inches
broad, and an inch thick, to the body of the Marquis, as he stood
upright, fastening it about the arms, the belly, and the legs; this
plank was about four feet long, and came almost up to his chin; a priest
who attended, then applied a crucifix to his mouth, and the two
executioners directly laid him on his belly on the bench, lifted up the
upper part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> board which was to receive his neck, adjusted his
head properly, then shut the board and pulled the string which is
fastened to the peg at the top of the machine, which lifted up a latch,
and down came the axe; the head was off in a moment, and fell into a
basket which was ready to receive it, the executioner took it out and
held it up by the hair to show the populace, and then put it into
another basket along with the body: very little blood had issued as yet.</p>

<p>The Priest was now taken out of the coach, from which he might have seen
his companion suffer; the bloody axe was hoisted up and he underwent the
same operation exactly. Each of these executions lasted about a minute
in all, from the moment of the criminal's ascending the scaffold to that
of the body's being taken away. It was now seen that the body of the
Marquis made such a violent expiration that the belly raised the lid of
the basket it was in, and the blood rushed out of the great arteries in
torrents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The windows of the <i>Place de Gr&ecirc;ve</i> were, as usual on such occasions,
filled with ladies.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Many persons were performing on violins, and
trumpets, in order to pass the time away, and to relieve the tediousness
of expectation.</p>

<p>I have on several other days seen felons sitting on stools on this
scaffold, with their hands tied, and their arms and bodies fastened to a
stake by a girth, bareheaded, with an inscription over their heads,
specifying their crimes and punishment; they are generally thus exposed
during five or fix hours, and then sent to prison, or to the gallies
according to the sentence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>I went once to Versailles; there is hardly any thing in the palace but
the bare walls, a very few of the looking-glasses, tapestry, and large
pictures remaining, as it has now been near two years uninhabited. I
crossed the great canal on foot; there was not a drop of water in it.</p>

<p>In the <i>Menagerie</i> I saw the Rhinoceros, which has been 23 years there;
there is likewise a lion, with a little dog in the same den, as his
companion, and a zebra.</p>

<p>The collection of orange trees cannot be matched in any country where
these trees do not grow naturally; the number is about six hundred, the
largest trunk is about fifteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> inches in diameter, and the age of the
most ancient of these trees exceeds three centuries.</p>

<p>The <i>Jardin Potager</i>, or kitchen garden, is of fifty acres, divided into
about five or six and twenty small gardens, of one, two, or three acres,
walled round, both for shelter to the plants, and for training fruit
trees against. One of these gardens, of two acres, was entirely allotted
to the culture of melons, and these were all of the warty <i>rock
cantalupe</i> kind, and were growing under hand-glasses, in the manner of
our late cucumbers for pickling.</p>

<p>The season had been so unfavourable for wall-fruit, that (as the
gardener told me) all these gardens had yielded less than a dozen
peaches and nectarines.</p>

<p>The fruit was sent regularly to the Royal Family in Paris.</p>

<p>There is a botanical garden at the <i>Petit Trianon</i> in the park of
Versailles, but the person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> who shews it was out of the way, so that I
did not see it.</p>

<p>I passed several mornings in the Botanical National Garden, (<i>ci-devant
Jardin du Roi</i>.) That part of the garden which contains the botanical
collection is separated from the other part, which is open to the public
at large, by iron palisades. The names of the plants are painted on
square plates of tin, stuck in the ground on the side of each plant. I
saw a <i>Strelitzia</i>, which was there called <i>Ravenala</i>, (probably from
some modern botanist's name) <i>Mr. Thouin</i>, who superintends this garden,
said to me, "We will not have any aristocratic plants, neither will we
call the new Planet by any other name than that of its discoverer,
<i>Herschel</i>." I neglected to ask him why the plant might not retain its
original and proper name of <i>Heliconia Bihai</i>?</p>

<p class="n q"><img src="images/041.jpg" alt="Anastatica" width="85%" />
<br /><span class="smcap">Anastatica</span> or <span class="smcap">Rose</span> of <span class="smcap">Jericho</span></p>

<p>I here found the <i>Anastatica Hierochuntica</i> or <i>Rose of Jericho</i>, which
I sought for in vain for several years, and advertised for in the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, for January 1791, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> in the newspapers. Many
descriptions and figures of this plant are to be found in old books, and
the dried plants are frequently to be met with. Old <i>Gerard</i> very justly
says, "The coiner spoiled the name in the mint, for of all plants that
have been written of, there is not any more unlike unto the rose." The
annexed figure represents a single plant; it had been transplanted into
a deep pot, which had been filled with earth, so as to make it appear
like two plants. The stalks are shrubby, the leaves are fleshy, and of a
glaucous or sea-green colour. The <i>corolla</i> consists of four very small
white petals. Its scientific description may be found in <i>Linn&aelig;us</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.
One of the <i>silicles</i> is drawn magnified.</p>

<p>Mr. Thouin pointed out to me a new and very beautiful species of
<i>Zinnia</i>, of which the flower is twice the size of that of the common
sort, and of a deep purple colour: a new <i>verbascum</i>, from the Levant;
it was about four feet high, the leaves were almost as woolly as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> those
of the <i>Stachys lanata</i>, and terminated in a point like a spur; it had
not yet flowered. And a new <i>solanum</i>, with spines the colour of gold.</p>

<p>He recommended the flower of the <i>spilanthus brasiliana</i>, which our
nurserymen call <i>Verbesina</i> <i>acmella</i> as an excellent dentifrice.</p>

<p>I also found here the <i>amethystea, c&oelig;rulea</i>: this annual has been lost
in England above twenty years.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The <i>datura fastuosa</i>, the French call <i>Trompette du jugement &agrave; trois
fleurs l'une dans l'autre</i>; I have myself raised these with triple
flowers, both purple and white, though some of our nurserymen pretended
the flowers were never more than double. The <i>anthemis arabica</i>, a very
singular and pretty annual. A <i>zinnia hybrida</i>, which last has not yet
been cultivated in England. Twenty-two sorts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> <i>medicago polymorpha,
(snails and hedgehogs</i>) of these I had seen only four in England.</p>

<p>Here was a small single moss-rose plant, in a pot, which is the only one
I ever saw in France. The air is too hot for those roses, and for the
same reason none of the American plants, such as the <i>magnolia</i> (tulip
tree) <i>kalmia</i>, &amp;c. thrive in France, though kept in pots in the shade
and well watered; the heat of the atmosphere dries the trunk of these
trees. But there are many other plants, to the growth of which the
climate is much more favourable than it is in England. In the open part
of this garden are a great number of <i>bignonia-catalpa</i> trees, which
were then in flower, resembling horse-chesnut flowers at a distance, but
much larger and more beautiful; and many <i>nerium oleander</i> trees, in
wooden chests; several of these trees are about eight feet high and the
trunk a foot in diameter; they were then full of flowers of all the
sorts, single and double, red and white; these are placed in the
green-house in the winter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>On a mount in this garden is a <i>meridien sonnant</i> (sounding meridian)
this is an iron mortar which holds four pounds of gunpowder, it is
loaded every morning, and exactly at noon the sun discharges the piece
by means of a burning glass, so placed that the <i>focus</i> at that moment
fires the powder in the touch-hole. The first meridian that was made of
this kind is in the garden of the <i>Palais Royal</i>, at the top of one of
the houses; I could not see it, but it is thus described in the <i>Paris
Guide</i>: "The touch-hole of the cannon is two inches long and half a line
(the twentieth part of an inch) broad, this length is placed in the
direction of the meridian line. Two <i>transoms</i> or <i>cross-staves</i> placed
vertically on a horizontal plane, support a <i>lens</i> or burning glass,
which, by their means, is fixed according to the sun's height monthly,
so as to cause the <i>focus</i> to be exactly over the touch-hole at noon. It
is said to have been invented by <i>Rousseau</i>." Small meridians of this
sort are sold in the shops; these are dials of about a foot square,
engraven on marble, with a little brass cannon and a <i>lens</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The market for plants and flowers in pots, and for nosegays, is kept on
the <i>Quai de la Megisserie</i>, twice a week, very early in the morning;
the following were the most abundant: <i>Nerium</i> double flowering
pomegranate, <i>vinca rosea</i>, (Madagascar periwinkle) <i>prickly lantana,
peruvian heliotropium</i> (turnsole) tuberoses, with very large and
numerous single and double flowers, and very great quantities of common
sweet basil, which is much used in cookery.</p>

<p>I visited the apothecaries garden, and also two or three nursery gardens
in that neighbourhood, but found nothing remarkable in them.</p>

<p>There are many gardens in the environs of Paris which are worthy of
notice, but I was prevented from seeing them in consequence of the
disturbances hereafter mentioned. In the books which describe these
places, I find the village of <i>Montreuil-sous-le-Bois</i> particularly
mentioned on account of its fertility. In the <i>Tableau de Paris</i> it is
said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> "Three acres of ground produce to the proprietor twenty thousand
livres annually, (near 800 guineas.) The rent of an acre is six hundred
livres, and the king's tax sixty (together about six and twenty
guineas.) The peaches which are produced here are the finest in the
world, and are sometimes sold for a crown a piece. When a prince has
given a splendid entertainment, three hundred Louis d'ors worth of these
fruits have been eaten." It is situated on a hill, just above
<i>Vincennes</i>, about three miles from the fauxbourg <i>Saint Antoine</i>, and
is likewise celebrated for its grapes, strawberries, all sorts of wall
fruit, pease, and every kind of esculent vegetables. In the garden
called <i>Mouceaux</i> which belongs to the <i>ci-devant Duke of Orleans</i>; at
the extremity of the <i>fauxbourg du Roule</i> are, it is said, magnificent
hot-houses, of which I have no recollection, though I was in the garden
in 1776. There is a description of these gardens in print, with sixteen
copper plates. In the <i>Luxembourg</i> gardens only common annuals were
growing, such as marigolds, sun-flowers, &amp;c. probably self sown; neither
were there in the <i>Tuileries</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> gardens, which I afterwards saw, any
remarkable plants.</p>

<p>I bought very large peaches in the markets at 30 <i>sous</i> each, the
ordinary ones were at 10 <i>sols</i>. The melons (which are brought to market
in waggons, piled up like turnips in England) were all of the netted
sort, and of so little flavor, that they would not be worth cultivating,
were it not for the sake of cooling the mouth in hot weather; they were
sold at 15 or 20 sous each. Strawberries were still plentiful (second
week in August.) <i>Cerneaux</i>, which are the kernel of green walnuts, were
just coming into season.</p>

<p>I had now no opportunity of acquiring any more knowledge of the plants
in France, and shall only add, that I passed the winter of 1783 and
1784, at <i>Marseille</i> and at <i>Hieres</i>; and that besides oranges, lemons,
cedras,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
 pistachios, pomegranates, and a few date palm trees, I
found several species of <i>geranium</i>, myrtles, and <i>cactus opuntia</i>,
(Indian fig) growing in the soil, and likewise the <i>mimosa farnesiana</i>,
sweet scented sponge tree, or fragrant acacia, the flowers of which are
there called <i>fleurs de cassier</i>; these flowers, together with those of
the jasmine, and those which fall from the orange and lemon trees, are
sold to the perfumers of <i>Provence</i> and <i>Languedoc</i>.</p>

<p>Among the small plants, the <i>arum arisarum</i>, (friar's cowl) and the
<i>ruscus aculeatus</i> (butcher's broom) were the most conspicuous, this
latter is a pretty ever-green shrub, and the berries were there as large
as those of a common <i>solanum pseudo capsicum</i>, (Pliny's <i>amomum</i>, or
winter cherry) and of a bright scarlet colour, issuing from the middle
of the under surface of the leaves; I never saw any of these berries any
where else. <i>Parkinson</i>, in his <i>Theater of Plants</i>, 1640, says, after
describing three or four species of this genus, "They scarse beare
flower, much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> lesse fruite, in our land." Perhaps the berries might
ripen in our hot-houses.</p>

<p>Many <i>arbutus</i>, or strawberry-trees, grow here, but they are not equal
in size and beauty to many which I saw both in Portugal and in Ireland.</p>

<p>In 1784, <i>M. J. J. de St. Germain</i>, a nurseryman in the <i>Fauxbourg St.
Antoine</i>, published a book in 8vo of 400 pages, entitled <i>Manuel des
Vegetaux</i>, or catalogue in Latin and French, of all the known plants,
trees, and shrubs, in the world, arranged according to the system of
<i>Linn&aelig;us</i>; those plants which grow near Paris are particularly
specified, and a very copious French index is added to the Latin one.
The author died a few years ago; the plants were sold, and the nursery
ground is at present built upon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="DOGS_AND_CATS_TWO-HEADED_BOY" id="DOGS_AND_CATS_TWO-HEADED_BOY"></a>DOGS AND CATS. TWO-HEADED BOY.</h3>


<p>LION Dogs and Cats are common in Paris.</p>

<p>The lion-dog greatly resembles a lion in miniature; the hair of the fore
part of its body is long, and curled, and the hinder part short; the
nose is short, and the tail is long and tufted at the extremity; the
smallest are little larger than guinea-pigs; these are natives of Malta,
and are the most valuable; those which are produced in France are
considerably larger, and the breed degenerates very soon. Their general
colour is white; they are frequently called <i>Lexicons</i>, which word is
derived, not from a dictionary, but from a French compound word of
nearly the same sound, descriptive of one of their properties.</p>

<p>The lion-cat comes originally from <i>Angora</i>, in <i>Syria</i>. It is much
larger than the common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> cat; its hair is very long, especially about the
neck, where it forms a fine ruff, of a silvery whiteness and silky
texture, that on the tail is three or four inches long; these cats
frequently spread their tails on their backs, as squirrels do. The
colour is generally white, but sometimes light brown; they do not catch
mice. This beautiful species does not degenerate speedily, and it
appears to thrive better in Paris than in any other part of Europe. The
figures of both these animals are in <i>Buffon's Natural History</i>.</p>

<p>About the <i>Palais Royal</i> persons are frequently found who offer for sale
white mice in cages; these are pretty little animals, their fur is snow
white, and their eyes are red and sparkling. Other persons carried for
sale canary-birds, linnets, and two or three other sorts of small birds,
perched on their fingers; these birds had been rendered so tame that
they did not attempt to fly away.</p>

<p>But the greatest curiosity in Natural History which I saw there, was a
male child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> with two heads and four arms; it was then three months old,
the two faces were perfectly alike, the noses aquiline, the eyes blue,
and the countenances pleasing; the two bodies were joined together at
the chest, and the remainder was just like that of a common male child;
one navel, one belly, one <i>penis</i> one <i>anus</i>, and two legs. The two
bodies were face to face, so that they could embrace and kiss each
other; in their natural position they formed an angle of 65 degrees,
like the letter Y. I remained above an hour with this child, it's mother
and the nurse, and saw it suck at both breasts at the same time. It was
tolerably strong, the skin was very soft, and almost transparent, the
arms and legs were very lean, and the latter were crossed, and appeared
incapable of being extended voluntarily; so that if the child should
live two or three years, which I do not think probable, it is not likely
it will ever be able to walk. One head would laugh while the other
cried, one head would sleep whilst the other was awake; the inspiration
and expiration of the breath, in each, was alternate, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> is to say,
one inspired while the other expired its breath. There was nothing
remarkable in the mother (a peasant's wife) except her obstinacy in
refusing to disencumber these two poor heads from a couple of thick
quilted blue sattin caps with which they had dressed them, and which I
endeavoured to convince both her and the nurse would heat the heads, so
as to be the means of shortening the child's life, and consequently of
curtailing the profits arising from this <i>unique</i> exhibition.</p>

<p>To this description an English physician, who likewise saw it, adds, "It
must have had two brains, as motion and sensation were equal, and
apparently perfect, in each head and chest, and in all the four arms. It
had two hearts, and two sets of lungs; it had also two passages into the
stomach, but, as was supposed, only one set of <i>abdominal viscera</i>, as
the belly was not larger than that of a common child of that age usually
is. The hearts and arteries beat more strongly than was consistent with
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> long continuance of health. The action of the arteries was plainly
seen under the skin."</p>

<p>Mr. Buffon, in the Supplement to his Natural History, has given the
figure and description of a monster something similar to this, part of
which description I shall give in a note, as a parallel to that of the
living child.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>I went several times to the National Assembly; the <i>Tribunes</i>, or
<i>Galleries</i>, (of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> there are three) entered warmly, by applauses
and by murmurs and hisses, into the affairs which were treated of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Letters are franked by the assembly as far as the frontiers, by being
stamped with red printers ink, <i>Ass. Nationale.</i></p>

<p>About this time many hundreds of folio volumes of heraldry, and of the
registers of the nobility, were publicly burnt in <i>la Place Vend&ocirc;me</i>,
after due notice had been given of the time and place by advertisements
pasted against the walls. A wicked wag observed, that it was a pity all
their books of divinity, and almost all those of law and physic, were
not added to the pile but he comforted himself with reflecting that <i>&ccedil;a
viendra</i>.</p>

<p>All the coats of arms which formerly decorated the gates of <i>H&ocirc;tels</i> are
taken away, and even seals are at present engraven with cyphers only.</p>

<p><i>The Chevaliers de St. Louis</i> still continue to wear the cross, or the
ribband, at the button-hole; all other orders of knighthood are
abolished. No liveries are worn by servants, that badge of slavery is
likewise abolished;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> and also all corporation companies, as well as
every other monopolizing society; and there are no longer any <i>Royal</i>
tobacco nor salt shops.</p>

<p>I went once to the <i>Caf&eacute; de la Regence</i>,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> with the intention of
playing a game at chess, but I found the chess-men so very little
different in colour, that I could not distinguish them sufficiently to
be able to play. It seems it is the fashion for chess-men at present to
be made of box-wood, and all nearly of the same colour. I then went to
another coffee-house frequented by chess-players, and here the matter
was worse; they had, in addition to the above-mentioned fashion,
substituted the <i>cavalier</i>, or <i>knight</i>, for the <i>fou</i>, or <i>bishop</i>, and
the <i>bishop</i> for the <i>knight</i>, so that I left them to fight their own
battles.</p>

<p>Books of all sorts are printed without any <i>approbation</i> or <i>privil&ecirc;ge</i>.
Many are exposed on stalls, which are very improper for the public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> eye.
One of these was called the <i>Private Life of the Queen</i>, in two volumes,
with obscene prints. The book itself is contemptible and disgusting, and
might as well have been called the <i>Woman of Pleasure</i>. Of books of this
sort I saw above thirty, with plates. Another was on a subject not fit
even to be mentioned.</p>

<p>I read a small pamphlet, entitled "<i>le Christ-Roi</i>, or a Parallel of the
Sufferings of Lewis XVI. &amp;c." I can say nothing in favor of it.</p>

<p>I found no new deistical books, the subject has already been exhausted,
and every Frenchman is a philosopher now; it may be necessary here to
recollect, that there are gradations in philosophy.</p>

<p>Since the Revolution, monarchs and courts are not quite so respectfully
mentioned in books as they were formerly. The following few examples are
taken from <i>Mr. du Laure's</i> Curiosities of Paris, in two volumes, 1791,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
third edition.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> "Louis XIV. has his bust in almost every street in
Paris. After the most trifling reparation of a street it was customary
to place his great wig-block (<i>t&ecirc;te &agrave; perruque</i>) there. The saints have
never obtained such multiplied statues. That bully (<i>Fanfaron</i>) as
<i>Christina</i>, Queen of Sweden, used to call him, wanted to be adored even
in turn-again alleys (<i>culs-de-Sac.</i>") Courtiers are here termed
<i>canaille de la cour</i> (the rabble of the court;) the former aldermen of
Paris (<i>echevins</i>) <i>machines &agrave; complimens</i> (complimenting machines;) and
monks <i>des bourreaux encapuchonn&eacute;s</i> (cowled executioners.)</p>

<p>All the following articles of information are taken from the same work:
The colossal statue of <i>St. Christopher</i> is no longer in the church of
<i>Notre-Dame</i>; "He was, without doubt, the greatest <i>Saint Christopher</i>
in all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> France. This ridiculous monument of the taste and devotion of
our ancestors has lately been demolished."</p>

<p>"The court before the porch of this church was considerably enlarged in
1748, and at the same time a fountain was destroyed, against which
leaned an old statue, which had successively been judged to be that of
<i>Esculapius</i>, of <i>Mercury</i>, of a Mayor, and of a Bishop of Paris, and
lastly, that of J.C."</p>

<p>"Entering the street which leads to the <i>Pont-rouge</i>, by the cloisters
of this church, the last house on the right, under the arcades, stands
where the canon <i>Fulbert</i>, uncle to <i>Eloisa</i>, lived. Although it has
been several times rebuilt during 600 years, there are still preserved
two stone medallions, in <i>basso-relievo</i>, which are said to be the busts
of <i>Abelard</i> and <i>Eloisa</i>."</p>

<p>The number of inhabitants in Paris is computed at one million, one
hundred and thirty thousand, (including one hundred and fifty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> thousand
strangers) two hundred thousand of which are, through poverty, exempt
from the poll-tax, and two hundred thousand others are servants.</p>

<p>In 1790 there were in Paris forty-eight convents of monks, containing
nine hundred and nine men; the amount of their revenue was estimated at
two millions, seven hundred and sixty thousand livres; five abbeys or
priories, estimated at six hundred and twelve thousand livres;
seventy-four convents of nuns, containing two thousand, two hundred and
ninety-two women, their income two millions and twenty-eight thousand
livres. When to these we add the revenue of the archbishoprick, and of
the fifteen collegiate churches, of one million, six thousand and five
hundred livres, we shall have a total of upwards of seven millions of
livres for the former ecclesiastical revenue in Paris only.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>There are about six hundred coffee-houses in Paris.</p>

<p>In the saloon of the <i>Louvre</i> every other year is an exhibition of
pictures, in the months of August and September.</p>

<p>The Pont-neuf is one hundred toises in length and twelve in breadth.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Describing the church of <i>St. John of the Minstrels</i>, so called, because
it was founded by a couple of fidlers, in 1330. <i>M. du Laure</i> says,
"Among the figures of saints with which the great door is decorated, one
is distinguished who would play very well on the fiddle, if his
fiddle-stick were not broken."</p>

<p>There is a parcel-post as well as a letter penny-post in Paris.</p>

<p>The salary of the executioner was eighteen thousand livres <i>per annum</i>;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a><br />

<p>There are no longer any <i>Espions de Police</i>, or spies, employed by
government. "That army of thieves, of cut-throats, and rascals, kept in
pay by the ancient police, was perhaps a necessary evil in the midst of
the general evil of our old administration. A body of rogues and
traitors could be protected by no other administration than such a one
as could only subsist by crimes and perfidy. Those were the odious
resources of despotism. Liberty ought to make use of simple and open
means, which justice and morality will never disavow."</p>

<p>There is a school at the point of the isle of St. Louis, in the river
<i>Seine</i>, to teach swimming; persons who chuse to learn in private pay
four <i>louis</i>, those who swim among others, half that sum, or half-crown
a lesson; if they are not perfect in that art in a season, (five summer
months) they may attend the following season <i>gratis</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="DRESS_INNS" id="DRESS_INNS"></a>DRESS. INNS.</h3>


<p>THE common people are in general much better clothed than they were
before the Revolution, which may be ascribed to their not being so
grievously taxed as they were. An English Gentleman who has gone for
many years annually from Calais to Paris, remarks, that they are almost
as well dressed on working days at present, as they were on Sundays and
holidays formerly.</p>

<p>All those ornaments which three years ago were worn of silver, are now
of gold. All the women of the lower class, even those who sit behind
green-stalls, &amp;c. wear gold ear-rings, with large drops, some of which
cost two or three <i>louis</i>, and necklaces of the same. Many of the men
wear plain gold ear-rings; those worn by officers and other gentlemen
are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> usually as large as a half-crown piece. Even children of two years
old have small gold drops in their ears. The general dress of the women
is white linen or muslin gowns, large caps which cover all their hair,
excepting just a small triangular piece over the forehead, pomatumed, or
rather plaistered and powdered, without any hats: neither do they wear
any stays, but only <i>corsets</i> (waistcoats or jumps.) Tight lacing is not
known here, nor yet high and narrow heeled shoes. Because many of the
ladies <i>ci-devant</i> of quality have emigrated or ran away, and that those
which remain in Paris, keep within doors, I saw no face that was
painted, excepting on the stage. Most of the men wear coats made like
great-coats, or in other words, long great-coats, without any coat: this
in fine weather and in the middle of summer made them appear to me like
invalides. There is hardly any possibility of distinguishing the rank of
either man or woman by their dress at present, or rather, there are no
ranks to distinguish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The nation in general is much improved in cleanliness, and even in
politeness. The French no longer look on every Englishman as a lord, but
as their equal.</p>

<p>The inns on the road from <i>Calais</i> to <i>Paris</i>, are as well furnished,
and the beds are as clean at present as almost any in England. At
<i>Flixcourt</i> especially, the beds are remarkably excellent, the furniture
elegant, and there is a profusion of marble and of looking-glasses in
this inn. The plates, dishes, and basons which I saw in cupboards, and
on shelves in the kitchen, and which are not in constant use, were all
of silver, to which being added the spoons and forks of the same metal,
of which the landlord possesses a great number; the ladies and gentlemen
who were with me there, going to and returning from Paris, estimated the
value at, perhaps, a thousand pounds sterling. Now, if we allow only
half this sum to be the value, it is, notwithstanding, considerable.
Every inn I entered was well supplied with silver spoons, of various
sizes, and with silver four pronged forks; even those petty
eating-houses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> in Paris, which were frequented by soldiers and
<i>sans-culottes</i>.</p>

<p>There are no beggars to be seen about the streets in Paris, and when the
chaise stopped for fresh horses, only two or three old and infirm people
surrounded it and solicited charity, whereas formerly the beggars used
to assemble in hundreds. I did not see a single pair of <i>sab&ocirc;ts</i>
(wooden-shoes) in France this time. The table of the peasants is also
better supplied than it was before the revolution.</p>

<h3><a name="ASSIGNATS" id="ASSIGNATS"></a>ASSIGNATS.</h3>


<p>EXCEPTING the coins which I purchased at the mint in Paris, I did not
see a piece of gold or silver of any kind; a few brass sols and two sols
were sometimes to be found in the coffee-houses, and likewise
<i>Mouneron's</i> tokens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The most common <i>assignats</i> or bills, are those of five <i>livres</i>, which
are printed on sheets; each sheet containing twenty of such <i>assignats</i>,
or a hundred <i>livres</i>; they are cut out occasionally, when wanted for
change. I do not know that there are any of above a thousand <i>livres</i>.
The lowest in value which I saw were of five <i>sols</i>, and these were of
parchment. Those of five <i>livres</i> and upwards, have the king's portrait
stamped on them, like that on the coins.</p>

<p>Besides the national <i>assignats</i>, which are current all over France,
every town has its own <i>assignats</i>, of and under, but not above five
<i>livres</i>; these are only current in such town and its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The <i>assignats</i> of and above five <i>livres</i> are printed on white paper,
those which are under, are for the convenience of the lower class of
people, of which few can read, printed on different coloured paper
according to their value; for instance, those of ten <i>sols</i> on blue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
paper, those of thirty on red, &amp;c. though this method is not correctly
adhered to.</p>

<p>I had projected many excursions in the neighbourhood of Paris, which
were all put a stop to, in consequence of the events of the tenth of
August, of which I shall give a true and impartial narrative, carefully
avoiding every word which may appear to favour either party, and writing
not as a politician, but as a spectator.</p>

<p>I had written many anecdotes, as well aristocratical as democratical,
but as I was unable properly to authenticate some of them, and that
others related to excesses which were inevitable, during such a time of
anarchy, I thought it not proper to prejudice the mind of the public,
and have accordingly expunged them all. I have only recounted facts, and

August, 1792, though not from similar causes. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> execrable massacre

<h3><a name="BATTLE_AND_MASSACRE_AT_THE_TUILERIES" id="BATTLE_AND_MASSACRE_AT_THE_TUILERIES"></a>BATTLE AND MASSACRE AT THE TUILERIES.</h3>


<p>ON Thursday, the 9th of August, the legislative body completed the
general discontent of the people, (which had been raised the preceding
day, by the discharge of every accusation against <i>la Fayette</i>) by
appearing to protract the question relative to the king's <i>d&eacute;ch&eacute;ance</i>
(forfeiture) at a time when there was not a moment to lose, and by not
holding any assembly in the evening.</p>

<p>The fermentation increased every minute, in a very alarming manner. The
mayor himself had declared to the representatives of the nation, that he
could not answer for the tranquillity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> of the city after midnight. Every
body knew that the people intended at that hour to ring the alarm-bell;
and to go to the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> of the <i>Tuileries</i>, as it was suspected that
the Royal Family intended to escape to Rouen, and it is said many trunks
were found, packed up and ready for taking away, and that many carriages
were seen that afternoon in the court-yard of the <i>Tuileries</i>.</p>

<p>At eight in the evening the <i>generale</i>,(a sort of beat of drum) was
heard in all the sections, the <i>tocsin</i> was likewise rung, (an alarm, by
pulling the bells of the churches, so as to cause the clappers to give
redoubled strokes in very quick time. Some bells were struck with large
hammers.)</p>

<p>All the shops were shut, and also most of the great gates of the hotels;
lights were placed in almost every window, and few of the inhabitants
retired to their repose: the night passed however without any other
disturbance; many of the members of the National Assembly were sitting
soon after midnight,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> and the others were expected. <i>Mr. Petion</i>, the
mayor, had been sent for by the king, and was then in the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>; the
number of members necessary to form a sitting, being completed, the
<i>tribunes</i> (galleries) demanded and obtained a decree to oblige the
<i>ch&acirc;teau</i> to release its prey, the mayor; he soon after appeared at the
bar, and from thence went to the <i>commune</i> (mansion-house.)</p>

<p>It was now about six o'clock on Friday morning (10th) the people of the
<i>fauxbourgs</i> (suburbs) especially of <i>St. Antoine</i> and <i>St. Marcel</i>,
which are parted by the river, assembled together on the <i>Place de la
Bastille</i>, and the crowd was so great that twenty-five persons were
squeezed to death.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> At seven the streets were filled with-armed
citizens, that is to say, with <i>federates</i> (select persons sent from the
provinces to assist at the <i>Federation</i>, or confederacy held last July
14) from <i>Marseille</i>, from <i>Bretagne</i>, with national guards, and
Parisian <i>sans-culottes</i>, (<i>without breeches</i>, these people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> have
<i>breeches</i>, but this is the name which has been given to the mob.) The
arms consisted of guns, with or without bayonets, pistols, sabres,
swords, pikes, knives, scythes, saws, iron crows, wooden billets, in
short of every thing that could be used offensively.</p>

<p>A party of these met a false patrol of twenty-two men, who, of course,
did not know the watch-word. These were instantaneously put to death,
their heads cut off and carried about the streets on pikes (<i>on promena
leurs t&ecirc;tes sur des piques.</i>) This happened in <i>la Place Vend&ocirc;me</i>; their
bodies were still lying there the next day. Another false patrol,
consisting of between two and three hundred men, with cannon, wandered
all night in the neighbourhood of the <i>theatre fran&ccedil;ais</i>: it is said
they were to join a detachment from the battalion of Henri IV. on the
<i>Pont-neuf</i>, to cut the throats of <i>Petion</i> and the <i>Marseillois</i>, who
were encamped on the <i>Pont St. Michel</i> (the next bridge to the
<i>Pont-neuf</i>) which caused the then acting parish assemblies to order an
honorary guard of 400 citizens, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> were to be answerable for the
liberty and the life of that magistrate, then in the council-chamber.
<i>Mandat</i>, commander-general of the National Guard, had affronted <i>M.
Petion</i>, when he came from the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> of the <i>Tuileries</i>, to go to
the National Assembly; he was arrested and sent to prison immediately.</p>

<p>The insurrection now became general; the <i>Place du Carrousel</i> (square of
the <i>Carousals</i>, a square in the <i>Tuileries</i>, so called from the
magnificent festival which Lewis XIV. in 1662, there gave to the queen
and the queen-mother) was already filled; the king had not been in bed;
all the night had probably been spent in combining a plan of defence, if
attacked, or rather of retreat; soon after seven the king, the queen,
their two children (the dauphin, seven years old, and his sister
fourteen) Princess Elizabeth, (the queen's sister, about 50 years old)
and the Princess <i>de Lamballe</i>, crossed the garden of the <i>Tuileries</i>,
which was still shut, escorted by the National Guard, and by all the
Swiss, and took refuge in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> National Assembly, when the Swiss
returned to their posts in the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>.</p>

<p>The alarm-bells, which were incessantly ringing, the accounts of the
carrying heads upon pikes, and of the march of almost all Paris in arms;
the presence of the king, throwing himself, as it were, on the mercy of
the legislative body; the fierce and determinate looks of the
<i>galleries</i>; all these things together had such an effect on the
National Assembly, that it immediately decreed the suspension of Lewis
XVI. which decree was received with universal applause and clapping.</p>

<p>At this moment a wounded man rushed into the Assembly, crying, "We are
betrayed, to arms, to arms, the Swiss are firing on the citizens; they
have already killed a hundred Marseillois."</p>

<p>This was about nine o'clock. The democrats, that is to say, the armed
citizens, as beforementioned, had dragged several pieces of cannon, six
and four pounders, into the <i>carousel</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> square, and were assembled
there, on the <i>quais</i>, the bridges, and neighbouring streets, in immense
numbers, all armed; they knew the king was gone to the National
Assembly, and came to insist on his <i>d&eacute;ch&eacute;ance</i> (forfeiture) or
resignation of the throne. All the Swiss (six or seven hundred) came out
to them, and permitted them to enter into the court-yard of the
Tuileries, to the number of ten thousand, themselves standing in the
middle, and when they were peaceably smoking their pipes and drinking
their wine, the Swiss turned back to back, and fired a volley on them,
by which about two hundred were killed;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the women and children ran
immediately into the river, up to their necks, many jumping from the
parapets and from the bridges, many were drowned, and many were shot in
the water, and on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> the balustrades of the <i>Pont-royal</i>, from the windows
of the gallery of the <i>Louvre</i>.</p>

<p>The populace now became, as it were, mad, they seized on five cannon
they found in the court yard, and turned them against the ch&acirc;teau; they
planted some more cannon on the <i>Pont-royal</i> and in the garden,
twenty-two pieces in all, and attacked the ch&acirc;teau on three sides at
once. The Swiss continued their fire, and it is said they fired seven
times to the people's once; the Swiss had 36 rounds of powder, whereas
the people had hardly three or four. Expresses were sent several miles
to the powder-mills, for more ammunition, even as far as <i>Essonne</i>,
about twenty miles off, on the road to <i>Fontainebleau</i>. The people
contrived however to discharge their twenty-two cannon nine or ten
times.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> From nine to twelve the firing was incessant; many waggons
and carts were constantly employed in carrying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> away the dead to a large
excavation, formerly a stone quarry, at the back of the new church <i>de
la Madeleine de la ville l'Eveque</i> (part of the <i>Fauxbourg St. Honor&eacute;</i>,
thus called.)</p>

<p>Soon after noon the Swiss had exhausted all their powder, which the
populace perceiving, they stormed the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>, broke open the doors,
and put every person they found to the sword, tumbling the bodies out of
the windows into the garden, to the amount, it is supposed, of about two
thousand, having lost four thousand on their own side. Among the slain
in the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>, were, it is asserted, about two hundred noblemen and
three bishops: all the furniture was destroyed, the looking-glasses
broken, in short, nothing left but the bare walls.</p>

<p>Sixty of the Swiss endeavoured to escape through the gardens, but the
horse (<i>gendarmerie nationale</i>) rode round by the street of <i>St.
Honor&eacute;</i>, and met them full butt at the end of the gardens; the Swiss
fired, killed five or six and twenty horses and about thirty men, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
were then immediately cut to pieces; the people likewise put the Swiss
porters at the <i>pont-tournant</i> (turning bridge) to death, as well as all
they could find in the gardens and elsewhere: they then set fire to all
the <i>casernes</i> (barracks) in the <i>carousel</i>, and afterwards got at the
wine in the cellars of the ch&acirc;teau, all of which was immediately drank;
many citizens were continually bringing into the National Assembly
jewels, gold, louis d'ors, plate, and papers, and many thieves were, as
soon as discovered, instantly taken to lamp irons and hanged by the
ropes which suspend the lamps. This timely severity, it is supposed,
saved Paris from an universal pillage. Fifty or sixty Swiss were hurried
by the populace to the <i>Place de Gr&ecirc;ve</i>, and there cut to pieces.</p>

<p>At about three o'clock in the afternoon every thing was tolerably quiet,
and I ventured out for the first time that day.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>quais</i>, the bridges, the gardens, and the immediate scene of battle
were covered with bodies, dead, dying, and drunk; many wounded and drunk
died in the night; the streets were filled with carts, carrying away the
dead, with litters taking the wounded to hospitals; with women and
children crying for the loss of their relations, with men, women, and
children walking among and striding over the dead bodies, in silence,
and with apparent unconcern; with troops of the <i>sans-culottes</i> running
about, covered with blood, and carrying, at the end of their bayonets,
rags of the clothes which they had torn from the bodies of the dead
Swiss, who were left stark naked in the gardens.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>One of these <i>sans-culottes</i> was bragging that he had killed eight Swiss
with his own hand. Another was observed lying wounded, all over blood,
asleep or drunk, with a gun, pistols, a sabre, and a hatchet by him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The courage and ferocity of the women was this day very conspicuous; the
first person that entered the <i>Tuileries</i>, after the firing ceased, was
a woman, named <i>Teroigne</i>, she had been very active in the riots at
<i>Brussels</i>, a few years ago; she afterwards was in prison a twelvemonth
at <i>Vienna</i>, and when she was released, after the death of the Emperor,
went to <i>Geneva</i>, which city she was soon obliged to leave; she then
came to <i>Paris</i>, and headed the <i>Marseillois</i>; she began by cleaving the
head of a Swiss, who solicited her protection, and who was
instantaneously cut in pieces by her followers. She is agreeable in her
person, which is small, and is about twenty-eight years of age.</p>

<p>Many men, and also many women, as well of the order of <i>Poissardes</i>
(which are a class almost of the same species and rank with our
fishwomen, and who are easily distinguished by their red cotton bibs and
aprons) as others, ran about the gardens, ripping open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> the bellies, and
dashing out the brains of several of the naked dead Swiss.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>At six in the evening I saw a troop of national guards and
<i>sans-culottes</i> kill a Swiss who was running away, by cleaving his skull
with a dozen sabres at once, on the <i>Pont-royal</i>, and then cast him into
the river, in less time than it takes to read this, and afterwards walk
quietly on.</p>

<p>The shops were shut all this day, and also the theatres; no coaches were
about the streets, at least not near the place of carnage; the houses
were lighted up, and patroles paraded the streets all night. Not a
single house was pillaged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The barracks were still in flames, as well as the houses of the Swiss
porters at the end of the gardens; these last gave light to five or six
waggons which were employed all night in carrying away the dead
carcases.</p>

<p>THE next day, Saturday the 11th, about an hundred Swiss who had not been
in the palace placed themselves under the protection of the National
Assembly. They were sent to the <i>Palais Bourbon</i> escorted by the
Marseillois, with <i>Mr. Petion</i> at their head, in order to be tried by a
court-martial.</p>

<p>The people were now employed, some in hanging thieves, others with
<i>Mademoiselle</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> <i>Teroigne</i> on horseback at their head, in pulling down
the statues of the French Kings.</p>

<p>The first was the equestrian one in bronze of Lewis XV. in the square of
the same name, at the end of the <i>Tuileries</i> gardens; this was the work
of <i>Bouchardon</i>, and was erected in 1763. At the corners of the pedestal
were the statues, also in bronze, of strength, peace, prudence, and
justice, by <i>Pigalle</i>. Many smiths were employed in filing the iron bars
within the horse's legs and feet, which fastened it to the marble
pedestal, and the <i>sans-culottes</i> pulled it down by ropes, and broke it
to pieces; as likewise the four statues above-mentioned, the pedestal,
and the new magnificent balustrade of white marble which surrounded it.</p>

<p>The next was the equestrians statue of <i>Lewis XIV.</i> in the <i>Place
Vend&ocirc;me</i>, cast in bronze, in a single piece, by Keller, from the model
of Girardon; twenty men might with ease have sat round a table in the
belly of the horse; it stood on a pedestal of white marble of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> thirty
feet in height, twenty-four in length, and thirteen in breadth. This
statue crushed a man to pieces by falling on him, which must be
attributed to the inexperience of the <i>pullers-down</i>.</p>

<p>The third was a pedestrian statue of <i>Lewis XIV.</i> in the <i>Place
Victoire</i>, of lead, gilt, on a pedestal of white marble; a winged
figure, representing victory, with one hand placed a crown of laurels on
his head, and in the other held a bundle of palm and olive branches. The
king was represented treading on <i>Cerberus</i> and the whole group was a
single cast. There were formerly four bronze slaves at the corners of
the pedestal, each of twelve feet high; these were removed in 1790. The
whole monument was thirty-five feet high, and was erected in 1689, at
the expence of the Duke <i>de la Feuillade</i>, who likewise left his duchy
to his heirs, on condition that they should cause the whole group to be
new gilt every twenty-five years; and who was buried under the
pedestal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sunday the 12th, at about noon, the equestrian statue, in bronze, of
<i>Henry IV.</i> which was on the <i>Pont-neuf</i>, was pulled down; this was
erected in 1635, and was the first of the kind in Paris. The horse was
begun at Florence, by <i>Giovanni Bologna</i>, a pupil of <i>Michael Angelo</i>,
finished by <i>Pietro Tacca</i>, and sent as a present to <i>Mary of Medicis</i>,
widow of <i>Henry IV.</i> Regent. It was shipped at <i>Leghorn</i>, and the vessel
which contained it was lost on the coast of Normandy, near <i>Havre de
Grace</i>, the horse remained a year in the sea, it was, however, got out
and sent to Paris in 1614.</p>

<p>This statue used to be the idol of the Parisians; immediately after the
revolution it was decorated with the national cockade; during three
evenings after the federation, in 1790, magnificent festivals were
celebrated before it.</p>

<p>It was broken in many pieces by the fall; the bronze was not half an
inch thick, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> the hollow part was filled up with brick earth.</p>

<p>The fifth and last was overthrown in the afternoon of the same day; it
was situated in the <i>Place Royale</i>; it was an equestrian statue in
bronze, of Lewis XIII. on a vast pedestal of white marble; it was
erected in 1639. The horse was the work of <i>Daniel Volterra</i>; the figure
of the king was by <i>Biard</i>.</p>

<p>The people were several days employed in pulling down all the statues
and busts of kings and queens they could find. On the Monday I saw a
marble or stone statue, as large as the life, tumbled from the top of
the <i>H&ocirc;tel de Ville</i> into the <i>Place de Gr&ecirc;ve</i>, at that time full of
people, by which two men were killed, as I was told, and I did not wish
to verify the assertion myself, but retired.</p>

<p>They then proceeded to deface and efface every crown, every <i>fleur de
lis</i>, every inscription wherein the words king, queen, prince, royal, or
the like, were found. The hotels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> and lodging-houses were compelled to
erase and change their names, that of the <i>Prince de Galles</i> must be
called <i>de Galles</i> only; that of <i>Bourbon</i> must have a new name; a sign
<i>au lys d'or</i> (the golden lily) was pulled down; even billiard tables
are no longer <i>noble</i> or <i>royal</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Pont-royal</i>, the new bridge of <i>Lewis XVI.</i> the <i>Place des
Victoires</i>, the <i>Place Royal</i>, the <i>Rue d'Artois, &amp;c.</i> have all new
names, which, added to the division of the kingdom into eighty-three
departments, abolishing all the ancient noble names of <i>Bourgogne,
Champagne, Provence, Languedoc, Bretagne, Navarre, Normandie, &amp;c.</i> and
in their stead substituting such as these: <i>Ain, Aube, Aude, Cher,
Creuse, Doubs, Eure, Gard, Gers, Indre, Lot, Orne, Sarte, Tarne, Var,
&amp;c.</i> which are the names of insignificant rivers; to that of Paris into
forty-eight new sections, and to all titles being likewise abolished,
makes it very difficult for a stranger to know any thing about the
geography of the kingdom, nor what were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> the <i>ci-devant</i> titles of such
of the nobility as still remain in France, and who are at present only
known by their family names.</p>

<p>BUT to return to those "active citizens, whom aristocratic insolence has
stiled <i>sans-culottes, brigands</i>."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>On Sunday, they dragged a man to the <i>H&ocirc;tel de Ville</i>, before a
magistrate, to be tried, for having stolen something in the <i>Tuileries</i>
as they said. He was accordingly tried, searched, and nothing being
found on him, was acquitted; <i>n'importe</i>, said these citizens,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> we must
have his head for all that, for we caught him in the act of stealing.
They laid him on his back on the ground, and in the presence of the
judge, who had acquitted him, they sawed off his head in about a quarter
of an hour, with an old notched scythe, and then gave it to the boys to
carry about on a pike, leaving the carcase in the justice-hall.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>At the corner of almost every chief street is a black marble slab,
inserted in the wall about ten feet high, on which is cut in large
letters, gilt, <i>Loix et actes de l'autorit&eacute; publique</i> (laws and acts of
the public authority) and underneath are pasted the daily and sometimes
hourly decrees and notices of the National Assembly. One of these
acquainted the citizens, that <i>Mandat</i> (the former commander-general of
the national guards) had yesterday undergone the punishment due to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> his
crimes; that is to say, the people had cut off his head.</p>

<p>During several days, after <i>the day I</i> procured all the Paris
newspapers, about twenty, but all on the same side, as the people had
put the editors of the aristocratic papers, <i>hors d'&eacute;tat de parler</i>
(prevented their speaking) by beheading one or two of them, and
destroying all their presses.</p>

<p>They, about this time, hanged two money changers (people who gave paper
for <i>louis d'or</i>, crowns, and guineas) under the idea that the money was
sent to the emigrants.</p>

<p>On the Saturday morning, at seven, I was in the <i>Tuileries</i> gardens;
only thirty-eight dead naked bodies were still lying there; they were
however covered where decency required; the people who stript them on
the preceding evening, having cut a gash in the belly, and left a bit of
the shirt sticking to the carcase by means of the dried blood. I was
told, that the body of a lady had just been carried out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> the
<i>Carousel</i> square; she was the only woman killed, and that probably by
accident. Here I had the pleasure of seeing many beautiful ladies (and
ugly ones too as I thought) walking arm in arm with their male friends,
though so early in the morning, and forming little groups, occupied in
contemplating the mangled naked and stiff carcases.</p>

<p>The fair sex has been equally courageous and curious, in former times,
in this as well as in other countries; and of this we shall produce a
few instances, as follows:</p>

<p>ON the 24th of August, St. Bartholemew's day, 1572, the massacre of the
Hugonots or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> or Calvinists, began by the murder of Admiral <i>Coligni</i> the
signal was to have been given at midnight; but <i>Catherine of Medicis</i>,
mother to the then King Charles IX. (who was only two and twenty years
of age) <i>hastened the signal more than an hour</i>, and endeavoured to
encourage her son, by quoting a passage from a sermon: "What pity do we
not shew in being cruel? what cruelty would it not be to have pity?"</p>

<p>In <i>Mr. Wraxall's</i> account of this massacre, in his <i>Memoirs of the
Kings of France of the Race of Valois</i>, compiled from all the French
historians, he says, <i>Soubise</i>, covered with wounds, after a long and
gallant defence, was finally put to death under the queen-mother's
windows. The ladies of the court, from a savage and horrible curiosity,
went to view his naked body, disfigured and bloody.</p>

<p>"An Italian first cut off <i>Coligni's</i> head, which was presented to
<i>Catherine of Medicis</i>. The populace then exhausted all their brutal and
unrestrained fury on the trunk. They cut off the hands, after which it
was left on a dunghill;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> in the afternoon they took it up again, dragged
it three days in the dirt, then on the banks of the <i>Seine</i>, and lastly
carried it to <i>Montfaucon</i> (an eminence between the <i>Fauxbourg St.
Martin</i> and the <i>Temple</i>, on which they erected a gallows.) It was here
hung by the feet with an iron chain, and a fire lighted under it, with
which it was half roasted. In this situation the King and several of the
courtiers went to survey it. These remains were at length taken down
privately in the night, and interred at <i>Chantilly</i>."</p>

<p>"During seven days the massacre did not cease, though its extreme fury
spent itself in the two first."</p>

<p>"Every enormity, every profanation, every atrocious crime, which zeal,
revenge, and cruel policy are capable of influencing mankind to commit,
stain the dreadful registers of this unhappy period. More than five
thousand persons of all ranks perished by various species of deaths. The
<i>Seine</i> was loaded with carcases floating on it, and <i>Charles</i> fed his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
eyes from the windows of the <i>Louvre</i>, with this unnatural and
abominable spectacle of horror. A butcher who entered the palace during
the heat of the massacre, boasted to his sovereign, baring his bloody
arm, that he himself had dispatched an hundred and fifty."</p>

<p>"<i>Catherine of Medicis</i>, the presiding demon, who scattered destruction
in so many shapes, was not melted into pity at the view of such
complicated and extensive misery; she gazed with savage satisfaction on
the head of <i>Coligni</i> which was brought her."</p>

<p><i>Sully</i> only slightly mentions this massacre of which he was
notwithstanding an eye-witness, because he was but twelve years of age.</p>

<p><i>Mezeray</i> gives the most circumstantial account of it; he says, "The
streets were paved with dead or dying bodies, the <i>portes-coch&ecirc;res</i>,
(great gates of the hotels) were stopped up with them, there were heaps
of them in the public squares, the street-kennels overflowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> with
blood, which ran gushing into the river. Six hundred houses were
pillaged at different times, and four thousand persons were massacred
with all the inhumanity and all the tumult than can be imagined."</p>

<p>"Among the slain was <i>Charles de Quelleue Pontivy</i>, likewise called
<i>Soubise</i>, because he had married <i>Catherine</i>, only daughter and heiress
of <i>Jean de Partenay</i> Baron <i>de Soubise</i>: this Lady had entered an
action against him for impotence; His naked dead body being among others
dragged before the <i>Louvre</i>, there were ladies curious enough to examine
leisurely, if they could discover the cause or the marks of the defeat
of which he had been accused."</p>

<p><i>Brantome</i>, in his memoirs of <i>Charles IX.</i> says, "As soon as it was day
the king looked out of the window, and seeing that many people were
running away in the <i>fauxbourg St. Germain</i>, he took a large hunting
<i>arquebuse</i>, and shot at them many times, but in vain, for the gun did
not carry so far."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<p>"He took great pleasure in seeing floating in the river, under his
windows, more than four thousand dead bodies."</p>

<p>A French writer, <i>Mr. du Laure</i>, in a Description of Paris, just
published, says, "About thirty thousand persons were killed on that
night in Paris and in the country; few of the citizens but were either
assassins or assassinated. Ambition, the hatred of the great, of a
woman, the feebleness and cruelty of a king, the spirit of party, the
fanaticism of the people, animated those scenes of horror, which do not
depose so much against the French nation, at that time governed by
strangers, as against the passions of the great, and the ill-directed
zeal of the religion of an ignorant populace."</p>

<h3><a name="MISCELLANIES_NUMBER_OF_SLAIN" id="MISCELLANIES_NUMBER_OF_SLAIN"></a>MISCELLANIES. NUMBER OF SLAIN.</h3>


<p>ON that same Saturday morning the dead Swiss, the broken furniture of
the palace, and the burning woodwork of the barracks, were all gathered
together in a vast heap, and set fire to. I saw this pile at twenty or
thirty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> yards distance, and I was told that some of the women who were
spectators took out an arm or a leg that was broiling, to taste: this I
did <i>not see</i>, but I see no reason for <i>not believing it</i>.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of this day, the coffee-houses were, as usual, filled
with idle people, who amused themselves with playing at the baby-game of
<i>domino</i>.</p>

<p>No coaches except fiacres (hackney-coaches) were now to be seen about
the streets; the theatres continued on the following mornings to
advertise their performances, and in the afternoon fresh advertisements
were pasted over these, saying, there would be <i>rel&acirc;che au theatre</i>
(respite, intermission.) A few days after, some of the theatres
advertised to perform for the benefit of the families of the slain, but
few persons attended the representation, through fear; because the
<i>sans-culottes</i> talked of pulling down all the theatres, which, they
said, <i>gataient les m&oelig;urs</i>, (corrupted the morals) of the people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Ever since the 10th, I knew the barriers had been guarded, to prevent
any person from leaving Paris, but I now was informed that that had been
the case, three days previous to that day, which may seem to imply that
some apprehensions were formed, that violent measures would take place
somewhere.</p>

<p>About this time the officers were obliged by the <i>sans-culottes</i> to wear
worsted instead of gold or silver shoulder-knots; and no more <i>cloudy</i>
carriages were to be seen in the streets.</p>

<p>Portraits of the king, with the body of a hog, and of the queen, with
that of a tygress were engraven and publicly sold. A book was published,
entitled, <i>Crimes of Louis</i> XVI. the author of which advertised that he
was then printing a book of the <i>Crimes of the Popes</i>, after which he
intended to publish the crimes of all the potentates in Europe.</p>

<p>As I could not get out of Paris, to make any little excursions to
nursery and other gardens,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> to <i>Vincennes</i>, to <i>Montreuil</i>, and as the
inhabitants of Paris were too much alarmed to retain any relish for
society, (public places out of the question,) I was desirous of getting
away as soon as possible, and applied first to the usual officers for a
pass, which was refused. That of <i>Lord Gower</i> (the ambassador) was at
this time of no use, but it became so afterwards, as shall be mentioned.</p>

<p>On the Monday (13th August) I wrote a letter of about ten lines to the
President of the National Assembly, soliciting a pass. This I carried
myself, and sent it in by one of the clerks. The President immediately
read the letter, and the Assembly decreed a pass for me; but the next
day, when I applied for it to the <i>comit&eacute; de surveillance</i>, (committee
of inspection) it, or they, knew nothing of the matter. I then went to
the <i>mairie</i> (mayoralty house) but in vain.</p>

<p>Here an officer of the national guard who had been present during the
whole of the battle of the 10th, said to me, "La journe&eacute; a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> <i>et&eacute; un peu
forte, nous avons eu plus de quinze cens des notres de tu&eacute;s</i>," (the day
was rather warm; we have had more than fifteen hundred of our own people
killed.) This was confirmed by many more of the officers there, with
whom I had a quarter of an hour's conversation, and they all estimated
the number of the slain at above six thousand, which may probably be
accounted for in the following manner, but a demonstration is
impossible.</p>

<p>Some assert that there were eight hundred Swiss soldiers in the
<i>ch&acirc;teau</i> of the <i>Tuileries</i>; others but five hundred: let us take the
medium of six hundred and fifty. They had, as every one allows, six and
thirty charges each, and they fired till their ammunition was expended.
This makes above three and twenty thousand shot, every one of which must
have taken place, on a mob as thick as hailstones after a shower: but
allowing for the Swiss themselves, who were killed during the
engagement, which diminishes the number of shot, and then allowing
likewise, that of two thousand persons who were in the palace, we here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
say nothing of the remaining thirteen or fourteen hundred, most of whom
were firing as well as they could, perhaps it may not appear exaggerated
to say, that out of above twenty thousand shot, four thousand must have
taken place mortally; and this includes the fifteen hundred of the
national guard, which were <i>certainly</i> known to be missing. Of the other
two thousand five hundred slain, the number could not so correctly be
ascertained, as they consisted of citizens without regimentals or
uniform, and of <i>sans-culottes</i>, none of whom were registered. All the
persons in the palace were killed; of these, few, if any, were taken
away immediately, whereas when any of the adverse party were killed,
there were people enough who were glad of the opportunity of escaping
from this slaughter, by carrying away the corpse. We must then reflect
on the number of waggons and carts employed all night in the same
offices, and then we shall see great reason to double the number of the
slain, as has been done in various publications.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>No idea of this number could be formed by seeing the field of battle,
because several bodies were there lying in heaps, and of the others not
above two or three could be seen at a time, as the streets were after
the engagement filled with spectators, who walked among and over the
carcases.</p>

<p>Of the feelings of these spectators, I judge by my own: I might perhaps
have disliked seeing a single dead body, but the great number
immediately reconciled me to the sight.</p>

<h3><a name="BREECHES_PIKES_NECESSARY_PASSPORTS" id="BREECHES_PIKES_NECESSARY_PASSPORTS"></a>BREECHES. PIKES. NECESSARY PASSPORTS.</h3>


<p>ANOTHER particular relative to the <i>sans-culottes</i> is their standard,
being an old pair of breeches, which they carry on the top of a pike,
thrust through the waistband: the <i>poissardes</i> likewise use the same
standard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> though it so happened that I never saw it. On the memorable
20th of June last, a pike-man got on the top of the Tuileries, where he
waved the ensign, or rather shook the breeches to the populace.</p>

<p>The pike-staves for the army are of different lengths; of six, nine, and
twelve feet: by this means three ranks of pike-bearers can use their
arms at once, with the points of the three rows of pikes evenly
extended.</p>

<p>The letter which I had written to the President, notwithstanding its
eventual ill success, caused several English persons jointly to write a
somewhat similar letter; in which, after having represented that their
<i>wives</i> and children <i>wanted</i> them, they said, they hoped their reasons
would appear <i>vrai-semblables</i>, or have the semblance of truth. The
Assembly on hearing this burst into a laugh, and passed on to the order
of the day.</p>

<p>On the 16th I carried a passport from <i>Lord Gower</i> to the office of <i>Mr.
le Brun</i>, the minister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> for foreign affairs; here I was told to leave
it, and I should have another in its stead the next day. The next day I
applied for it, and was told, no passports could be delivered.</p>

<p>The matter now appeared to me to become serious, as the courier who had
carried the account of the affair of the 10th to London was not yet
returned, and that rumours were spread, that the English in Paris were
almost all <i>grands seigneurs &amp; aristocrates</i>; so that I saw only two
probable means of safety; one of which was, to draw up a petition to the
National Assembly, in behalf of all the British subjects, to get it
signed by as many as I could find, and who might chuse to sign it, and
to carry it to the Assembly in a small body, which might have been the
means of procuring a pass; and in case this was refused, the other plan
would have been for all the British to have incorporated themselves into
a <i>Legion Britannique</i>, and offered their services according to the
exigence of the case.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> This petition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> was accordingly, on the 18th,
drawn up by a member of the English Parliament; translated into French,
and carried about to be signed; when at the bankers we fortunately met
with a person who informed us, that our passes were ready at the moment,
at <i>Mr. Le Brun's</i>: thither we went; I obtained my pass at two o'clock
afternoon, the petition was torn and given to the winds; I took a
hackney coach that instant, to carry me to the <i>Poste aux chevaux</i>,
ordered the horses, and before three I was out of the barriers of Paris.</p>

<p>Here follows a copy of my passport.</p>

<p>At the top of the paper is an engraving of a shield, on which is
inscribed <i>Vivre libre ou mourir</i> (live free or die,) supported by two
female figures, the <i>dexter</i> representing <i>Minerva</i> standing, with the
cap of liberty at the end of a pike; the <i>sinister</i>, the French
constitution personified as a woman sitting on a lion, with one hand
holding a book, on which is written <i>Constitution Fran&ccedil;aise, droits de
l'homme</i>, and with the other supporting a crown over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> shield, which
crown is effaced by a dash with a pen.</p>

<p>SOME days before the demolition of the statue of <i>Henri</i> IV. on the
<i>Pont-neuf</i>, there was a flag placed near that statue, on which was
painted <i>citoyens la Patrie est en danger</i>; (citizens, the
mother-country is in danger) and it still remained there when I came
away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Monday after <i>the</i> Friday, I saw a paper on the walls, among
those published by authority, wherein a person acquainted the public,
that on the preceding Saturday, in consequence of some suspicions which
had been entertained of his principles, his house had been visited by
above thirty thousand persons;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and that notwithstanding masons and
smiths had been employed in pulling down, breaking open and
scrutinizing, the people had <i>found nothing</i> to criminate him, and he
had <i>found nothing</i> missing in consequence of their scrutiny. I had the
pleasure of reading this aloud to an assemblage of elderly ladies, not
one of whom could see to read it, as it was placed out of their <i>focus</i>,
or too high, as they said.</p>

<p>Before the 10th I saw several dancing parties of the <i>Poissardes</i> and
<i>sans-culottes</i> in the beer-houses, on the <i>Quai des Ormes</i> and the
<i>Quai St. Paul</i>, and have played the favourite and animating air of <i>&ccedil;a
ira</i>, on the fiddle, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> eight couple of dancers; the ceiling of these
rooms (which open into the street) is not above ten feet high, and on
this ceiling (which is generally white washed) are the numbers 1 2 to 8,
in black, and the same in red, which mark the places where the ladies
and gentlemen are to stand. When the dance was concluded I requested the
ladies to salute me (<i>m'embrasser</i>) which they did, by gently touching
my cheek with their lips. But a period was put to all these amusements
by the occurrences of the 10th; after which day, most of my time was
employed in endeavouring to obtain a passport.</p>

<p>On the <i>Quai des Augustins</i>, at six or seven in the morning, may be seen
a market of above a quarter of a mile long, well stocked with fowls,
pigeons, ducks, geese and turkies: these birds are all termed
<i>Volaille</i>. Rabbits are likewise sold in this market. I also saw here a
few live pheasants, red-legged partridges and quails in cages, for
sale.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>I did not see a <i>louis d'or</i> this time in Paris, it is probable that a
new golden coin may be struck of a different value and name, and
<i>without</i> the name of the die-engraver.</p>

<p>There are few, if any, <i>tables d'h&ocirc;te</i> (ordinaries) in Paris at present,
except at the inns. I have not seen any for many years, because the hour
of dining at them is about one o'clock, and that is customary to be
served in those coffee-houses which are kept by <i>restaurateurs and
traiteurs</i> (cooks) after the English manner, at small tables, and there
are bills of fare, with the prices of the articles marked. The most
celebrated of these houses is called <i>la Taverne de Londres</i>, in the
garden of the <i>Palais-Royal</i>: here are large public rooms, and also many
small ones, and a bill of fare printed on a folio sheet, containing
almost every sort of provision, (carp, eels, and pickled salmon are the
only fish I have seen there.) An Englishman may here have his
beef-steak, plum-pudding, Cheshire cheese, porter and punch just as in
London, and at about the same price, (half the price as the exchange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
then was.) Thirty-five sorts of wine are here enumerated. That of
<i>Tokay</i> is at two <i>livres</i> for a small glass, of which a quart-bottle
may contain about fifteen. <i>Rhenish, Mountain, Alicante, Rota,</i> and red
<i>Frontignan</i> at 6 livres. <i>Champagne, Claret, Hermitage,</i> 4 <i>l.</i> 10<i>f.</i>
<i>Port</i> 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>f.</i> <i>Burgundy</i> 3<i>l.</i> <i>Porter</i> 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>f.</i> Most of the
dishes are of silver, and I dined at two or three other taverns where
all the dishes and plates were of silver.</p>

<p>The barbers or hair-dressers have generally written on their sign <i>Ici
on rajeunit: rajeunir</i> means properly to colour or die the hair, but in
this instance it only expresses, here people are made to look younger
than they are, by having their hair dressed. I saw a peruke-maker's sign
representing the fable of <i>the man and his two wives</i>, thus: A
middle-aged gentleman is fitting in a magnificent apartment, between an
old lady and a young one, fashionably dressed. His head is entirely
bald, the old lady having just pulled out the black hairs, as the young
one did the grey: and Cupid is flying over his head, holding a nice
periwig ready to put on it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="EXTENT_POPULATION_C_OF_FRANCE" id="EXTENT_POPULATION_C_OF_FRANCE"></a>EXTENT, POPULATION, &amp;C. OF FRANCE.</h3>


<p>THE authorities for a great part of what follows are <i>Mr. Rabaut's</i>
History of the Revolution, 1792; <i>Mr. du Laure's</i> Paris, 1791,
<i>Geographie de France</i>, 1792, second edition, and <i>Voyage dans les
Departemens de la France</i>, 1792.</p>

<p>France is a country which extends nine degrees from North to South, and
between ten and eleven from East to West, making six and twenty thousand
square leagues, and containing twenty-seven millions of people. In 1790,
"There were four millions of armed men in France; three of these
millions wore the uniform of the nation." The number of warriors, or
fighting men is very considerably increased since that time.</p>

<p>"In this immense population is found at least three millions of
individuals of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> different religions, whom the present catholicks look
upon with brotherly eyes. The protestant and the catholick now embrace
each other on the threshold where <i>Coligni</i> was murdered; and the
disciples of <i>Calvin</i> invoke the Eternal after their manner, within a
few paces<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of the balcony from whence <i>Charles IX.</i> shot at his
subjects."</p>

<p>The capital, when compared to London, for extent is as 264 to 195,
(nearly as 7 to 5) that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> is to say, according to the calculation
beforementioned (p. 28) Paris stands on 6 <sup>99</sup>/<sub>121</sub> square miles of ground,
and London on 5 <sup>35</sup>/<sub>968</sub>.</p>

<p>It contains a million and 130 thousand inhabitants, which is fifty
thousand more than it did two years ago; these formerly inhabited
<i>Versailles</i>, and left it at the time the court did.</p>

<p><i>Lyon</i> contains 160 thousand persons.</p>

<p><i>Marseille</i>, the most populous, in proportion to the size, of any city
in Europe, contains, in a spot of little more than three miles in
circumference, 120 thousand persons, which includes about 30,000
mariners on board of the ships in the harbour.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

inhabitants I cannot learn, such as <i>Toulouse, Toulon, Brest, Orange,
Blois, Avignon</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The nation gains five millions sterling <i>per annum</i> by the reduction of
its expences, and by not having any unnecessary clergymen to
maintain,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and the forfeited estates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> of the emigrants are estimated
at immense sums.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The heavy taxes on salt (<i>la gabelle</i>) and on Tobacco are suppressed,

<p>"No city in the world can offer such a spectacle as that of Paris,
agitated by some great passion, because in no other the communication is
so speedy, and the spirits so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> active. Paris contains citizens from all
the provinces, and these various characters blended together compose the
national character, which is distinguished by a wonderful impetuosity.
Whatever they will do is done." Witness the taking of the <i>Bastille</i> in
a single day, which had formerly withstood the siege of a whole army
during three and twenty days. And witness the 10th of August.</p>

<p>I have been frequently told by persons in England, that a regular and
disciplined army may easily crush a herd of raw and inexperienced
rabble, such as they supposed the French were, although ten times more
numerous. This may possibly be the event in small numbers, but if we
state the case with large numbers, for instance fifty thousand men of
the greatest courage, and of the most perfect discipline, and who are
fighting for pay, without any personal motive, against five hundred
thousand men, whom we shall suppose utterly ignorant of the art of war,

<p>THE paragraph at the bottom of page 11, is intended to be merely
descriptive, but not ludicrous, so that the reader is requested to
expunge the word <i>night</i>.</p>

<p>In the enumeration of the Bishopricks (page 14) I unaccountably omitted
the ten metropolitan sees, which are those of <i>Paris, Lyon, Bourdeaux,
Rouen, Reims, Besan&ccedil;on, Bourges, Rennes, Aix</i> and <i>Toulouse</i>: Thus there
are eighty-three bishopricks, or one for each department.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>After what is said (in page 89) relative to the division of the country,
there should, in justice, be added: "To the confused medley of
<i>Bailiwicks, Seneschal-jurisdictions, Elections, Generalities, Dioceses,
Parliaments, Governments, &amp;c.</i> there succeeded a simple and uniform
division; there were no longer any provinces, but only one family, one
nation: France was the nation of eighty-three departments."
Notwithstanding this, I regret the ancient <i>names</i> of the provinces. The
old <i>Atlas</i> of France is become useless, as the whole of its geography
is altered. The land is at present divided into nine regions, and each
of these into nine departments; Paris and the country about ten miles
around (24 square leagues) forms one, and the Island of <i>Corsica</i>
another department. In the modern <i>Atlas</i>, after every new name, is put
<i>ci-devant</i>, and then the old name, thus: <i>Region du Levant, departement
de la c&ocirc;te d'or, ci-devant Bourgogne</i>. I called one day, after dining in
a tavern, for a bottle of wine of the <i>Departement de l'Aube, Region des
Sources,</i> the landlord consulted his <i>Atlas</i>, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> brought the
bottle of <i>Champagne</i> I required. It will be some time before foreigners
are sufficiently familiarized to the new phrases which must be used for
<i>Gascon, Normand, Breton, Proven&ccedil;al, Picard, &amp;c.</i><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The following paragraphs are taken from the new <i>Voyage de France</i>.</p>

<p>"During fourteen hundred years, priority in follies, in superstition, in
ignorance, in fanaticism, and in slavery, was the picture of France. It
was just, therefore, that priority in philosophy, and in knowledge,
should succeed to so many odious pre-eminences."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"The French people, to whom liberty is now new, are like the waves of
the sea, which roll long after the tempest has ceased: and of which the
agitation is necessary to depose on the shores the scum which covers
them."</p>

<p>"The confusion inseparable from a new order of things, has necessarily
caused Paris to swarm with vagabonds; so that far from being surprized
that some crimes have been committed, we ought rather to wonder that
they are not more frequent."</p>

<p>"When <i>Louis XVI.</i> was brought back to Paris (25 June, 1791) the
inhabitants of <i>fauxbourgs</i> pasted a placard (advertisement) against the
walls, saying, 'Whoever applauds him shall be cudgelled, whoever attacks
him shall be hanged.' An awful silence was observed."</p>

<p>After the account of the Pantheon (p. 28) should be added: In April,
1791, the body or <i>Mirabeau</i> was deposited here; and in July following
that of <i>Voltaire</i>. Soon after this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> it was decreed, that <i>Rousseau</i> had
merited the honours due to great men, but that his ashes should remain
where they were.</p>

<p>To the lift of engravings of the <i>Maiden</i> must be added another,
prefixed to a little tract, called <i>Gibbet-Law</i>.</p>

<p>By <i>premier An de l'Egalit&eacute;</i>,(first year of Equality) it is not to be
understood that every person in France is equal, but that as they have
no sovereign, no person is above, but every person is equally under the
protection of the law. This matter has been both misunderstood and
misrepresented in England.</p>

<p>On the 18th I was out of the barriers of Paris by three in the
afternoon, and proceeded to <i>Chantilly</i>, where we<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> arrived at nine,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>and remained for the night. We were informed that two hundred
<i>Sans-culottes</i> and <i>Marseillois</i> had walk'd here from Paris, (28 miles)
two or three days before, had pulled down an equestrian statue,
(probably that of the Constable <i>de Montmorenci</i>) cut off a man's head,
carried it about the streets on a pike, <i>&agrave; la mode de Paris</i>, caught and
eat most of the carp which had been swimming in the ponds which surround
the palace above a hundred years, were then in the stables and intended
to return to Paris the next day. They did no other damage to the
building than breaking the <i>Cond&eacute;</i> arms, which were carved in stone.</p>

<p>The night of the next day we passed at <i>Flixcourt</i>, and that of the
Monday at the Post-house, at the foot of the hill on which <i>Boulogne</i> is
situated.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the 21st we arrived at Calais in the morning; the wind was so
violent and unfavorable that we were detained here till the 24th, when
we failed, and had a passage of seven hours to Dover.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing to remark on the road from Paris to Calais, except
that the harvest was not yet got in, for want of hands, that the corn
was <i>lodged</i>, and sowing itself again; that every person and thing was
as quiet as if nothing had happened in Paris, and that no one knew the
particulars of what <i>had</i> happened.</p>

<p>At Calais many person wore trowsers, after the fashion of the
<i>Sans-culottes</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="EPILOGUE" id="EPILOGUE"></a>EPILOGUE.</h3>


<p>SOON after my return to London the two following paragraphs appeared in
the newspapers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"T. has been over to France, botanizing, and has gotten what he
went to seek."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, my Lord Fool, From this Nettle danger we pluck the
<i>Flower</i> safety."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> </p></div>

<p>This I insert merely on account of the B&ecirc;tise of the quotation. The
Dutch inscription on sticks of sealing-wax would have been as
applicable.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"T. the Tourist was the first to fly from Paris on the prospect of
the tumults of the 10th of August. He is now writing a History of
the Bloody Murders which distinguished that day." </p></div>

<p>I suspect that the ingenious Genius who wrote this knew he was mistaking
as to the former part of this paragraph. He may say <i>Trippist</i> now.</p>

<p>I should not have seen either of these, had they not been pointed out to
me by some of my "damned good-natured friends." I am in hopes of seeing
a number of very pretty criticisms on the foregoing pages; many passages
were written purposely to catch critics, as honey catches gnats; if
just, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> shall be attended to, should there be another edition; and
if they are merely absurd, they shall be collected, and faithfully
presented to the gentle reader. I have told the truth, and have not "set
down aught in malice."</p>

<p class="n">THE END.</p>

<p>*** There are a few trifling typographical errors in the foregoing
sheets, which I shall leave to the correction of the reader, as not one
of them affects the sense.</p>

has given a long account of such a machine, from which the following
particulars are taken. "It was confined to the limits of the forest of
Hardwick, or the eighteen towns and hamlets within its precincts. The
execution was generally at Halifax; Twenty five criminals suffered
during the reign of Queen Elizabeth; the records before that time were
lost. Twelve more were executed between 1623 and 1650, after which it is
supposed the privilege was no more exerted.&mdash;&mdash;This machine is now
destroyed, but there is one of the same kind, in a room under the
Parliament house, at Edinburgh, where it was introduced by the Regent
Morton, who took a model of it as he passed through Halifax, and at
length suffered by it himself. It is in form of a painters easel, and
about ten feet high: at four feet from the bottom is a cross-bar, on
which the felon laid his head, which was kept down by another placed
above. In the inner edges of the frame are grooves; in these is placed a
sharp axe, with a vast weight of lead, supported at the summit by a peg;
to that peg is fastened a cord, which the executioner cutting, the axe
falls, and beheads the criminal. If he was condemned for stealing a
horse or a cow, the string was tied to the beast, which pulled out the
peg and became the executioner."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> "In 1701 there were born in Hungary two Girls who were
joined together by the loins; they lived above twenty-one years. At
seven years old they were shown almost all over Europe; at nine years of
age a priest purchased them, and placed them in a convent at Petersburg,
where they remained till their death, which happened in 1723. An account
of them was found among the papers of the surgeon who attended the
convent, and was sent to the Royal Society of London in 1757. In this
account we are told, that one of these twins was called <i>Helen</i>, the
other <i>Judith</i>. <i>Helen</i> grew up and was very handy, <i>Judith</i> was smaller
and a little hump-backed. They were joined together by the reins, and in
order to see each other they could turn their heads only. There was one
common <i>anus</i>, and of course there was only one common need of going to
stool, but each had her separate urinary passage, and separate wants,
which occasioned quarrels, because when the weakest was obliged to
evacuate, the strongest, who sometimes would not stand still, pulled her
away; they perfectly agreed in every thing else, and appeared to love
each other. When they were seen in front, they did not differ apparently
from other women. At six years old <i>Judith</i> lost the use of her left
side by a paralytick stroke; she never was perfectly cured, and her mind
remained feeble and dull; on the contrary, <i>Helen</i> was handsome,
intelligent and even witty. They had the small-pox and the measles at
the same time, but all their other sicknesses indispositions happened to
each separately. <i>Judith</i> was subject to a cough and a fever, whereas
<i>Helen</i> was generally in good health. When they had almost attained the
age of twenty-two <i>Judith</i> caught a fever, fell into a lethargy and
died. Poor <i>Helen</i> was forced to follow her fate; three minutes before
the death of <i>Judith</i> she fell into an agony, and died nearly at the
same time. When they were dissected it was found, that each had her own
entrails perfect, and even, that each had a separate excretory conduit,
which however terminated at the same <i>anus</i>." <i>Linn&aelig;us</i> has likewise
described this monster. Many figures of double children of different
kinds may be seen in <i>Licetus de Monstris</i>, 4to. 1665; and in the
<i>Medical Miscellanies</i>, which were printed in Latin at Leipzig, in
several quarto volumes, in 1673.</p></div>

salary than fifty <i>Louis</i> per annum, not including his house and garden.
Many of the French at present think that clergymen should be retained
like physicians, and paid by those only who want them. By this means,
they say, religious quarrels would be avoided; of all quarrels the most
absurd, because nobody can understand any thing about the matter.
"Personne n'y entend rien."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> The civil list mentioned in page 62, was according to the
old establishment. In January, 1790, the king was requested to fix a sum
for the civil list himself, and in June following he sent a letter to
the National Assembly, demanding five and twenty millions of livres. It
was decreed that instant.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> I saw many thousands of these men (from my windows) on
their way to the <i>Tuileries</i>, early on <i>the</i> Friday morning; their march
was at the rate of perhaps five miles an hour, without running or
looking aside; and this was the pace they used when they carried heads
upon pikes, and when they were in pursuit of important business, rushing
along the streets like a torrent, and attending wholly and solely to the
object they had in view. On such occasions, when I saw them approaching,
I turned into some cross street till they were passed, not that I had
any thing to apprehend, but the being swept along with the crowd, and
perhaps trampled upon. I cannot express what I felt on seeing such
immense bodies of men so vigorously actuated by the same principle. I
saw also many thousands of volunteers going to join the armies at the
frontiers, marching along the <i>Boulevarts</i>, almost at the same pace,
accompanied as far as the Barriers by their women, who were carrying
their muskets for them; some with large sausages, pieces of cold meat,
and loaves of bread, stuck on the bayonets, and all laughing, or singing
<i>&ccedil;a ira</i>.

division of France may appear to geographers as defective as the ancient
one. Perhaps artists should have been more consulted. Then there would
not have been shown in it so much of the spirit of party, which, in
great assemblies, too often smothers the voice of reason, nor so many
effects of the ignorance of political measurers, who lightly stride over
barriers which nature has opposed to them, and who appear to have
forgotten the necessity of communications."</p></div>
